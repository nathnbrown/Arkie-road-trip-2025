Many days pass and people die very much.' -Recollection of a survivor of the Trail of Tears The Trail of Tears - Land Route After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the United States government forced tens of thousands of American Indians to leave their ancestral lands in the southeast for new homes in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They traveled over established land and water routes, all of which led through Arkansas. Rather than risk disease and other hazards of summer travel, many groups left in the fall and faced, instead, treacherous winter weather. Thousands died during the ordeal - remembered today as the Trail of Tears. Despite the hardships of the journey, the people of the five tribes of the Southeast established new lives in the West. They stand now as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions, while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. Federal Indian Removal In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly removed approximately 16,000 Cherokee, 21,000 Muscogee (Creek), 9,000 Choctaw, 6,000 Chickasaw, and 4,000 Seminole from the southeastern United States. Federal Indian removal policy aroused fierce and bitter debate. Supporters of the policy claimed it was a benevolent action to save the tribes east of the Mississippi River from being overwhelmed and lost in the onslaught of an expanding American population. Opponents decried its inhumanity and the tragic consequences it would have for the Indian peoples. One thing was certain: removal freed millions of acres of Indian lands for use by American settlers. Trail of Tears National Historic Trail In 1987, to commemorate this tragic chapter in American history, the United States Congress designated the primary land and water routes of the Cherokee removal as the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Today the National Park Service partners with the southeastern tribes; the Trail of Tears Association and other non-government organizations; federal, state, and local agencies; and private landowners to foster the appreciation and preservation of historic sites and segments and to tell the story of forced removal of the Cherokee people and other American Indian tribes. You can visit certified sites, segments, and interpretive facilities along the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail by following the Auto Tour Route. Look for the official trail logo along the way.

The news he carried was startling: Confederates were moving down the Telegraph Road a mile north of Elkhorn Tavern. All of General Curtis's careful troop positioning for a battle at Little Sugar Creek - to the south - was now useless. As gunfire from the far side of Elkhorn Mountain and the fields north of Leetown grew louder, Curtis had to move his remaining troops to prepare for the Confederate attack.

Teams pulling wagons and artillery rattled by. Here, across the road from Samuel Pratt's store, decisions were made that would determine the fate of two armies - and the state of Missouri. A temporary city of soldiers covered the field before you and the surrounding area. Here you would have seen the nerve center of the Union army during the two-day fight for Pea Ridge.

A Village Full of Wounded Men,36.44118591,-94.05073375,History,"""Entering a little clearing, we discovered the yellow hospital flags fluttering from the gables of every house in the hamlet of Leetown, and the surgeons busy with the sad, yet humane task that was theirs to perform. Lyman G. Bennett, private, 36th Illinois Infantry Regiment The quarter-mile-long trail you see ahead leads to the site of Leetown, Arkansas. Today the woods and meadows of the Pea Ridge battlefield appear to be an uninhabited wilderness. During the Civil War, this whole area was a patchwork quilt of working farms and woodlots. Leetown was made up of a dozen or so log-and-frame homes and outbuildings. As intense fighting ranged nearby in Oberson's cornfield and Morgan's Woods, stretcher bearers carried the wounded of both armies to Leetown, the closest place offering shelter from the winter weather. All the space in the houses was taken over by injured and dying soldiers. Yellow flags guided the walking wounded to medical attention. This 1862 illustration from Harper's Weekly magazine shows Union surgeons working in a combat aid station very similar to those set up in the houses here. No Civil War-era drawing that shows Leetown is known to exist. Battlefield artists did not follow the armies that fought in Arkansas in 1862.

Before ordering a massive charge into Oberson's cornfield, 'Old Ben,' as his troops called him, rode alone to the edge of the trees for a final scout. Yankee skirmishers behind a rail fence shot the popular general dead. No Confederate soldier or officer saw McCulloch fall. Minutes passed with no word. Finally second-in-command General James McIntosh took over, only to die while leading a charge out of the woods. With no leader to give orders for more than an hour, the momentum that might have led to a swift Confederate victory at Leetown was lost. (Captions under portraits on the lower right): General Ben McCulloch customarily wore a black velvet suit instead of a uniform. As the former Texas Ranger reconnoitered the woods' edge, he was easy to see.

Save the Cannon!,36.4448896,-94.0523605,History,"""Like maddened hornets, Confederate infantrymen boiled out of Morgan's Woods, crossed Leetown Road, and swarmed toward the six Federal cannon that had unlimbered in this corner of Oberson's cornfield.

Black bought the artillerymen time to save four of the six guns from being captured.

William Watson, sergeant, 3rd Louisiana Infantry Regiment Four regiments of volunteers from Arkansas and Louisiana, moving 'with all the vim and vigor [of] regulars,' ran headlong and unawares into two Illinois regiments near here. The close-range fighting was so intense that men from both armies threw themselves flat on the ground to survive the hurricane of flying lead. Military order dissolved. Squads of soldiers rushed from stump to log to tree in the thick, tangled undergrowth, kneeling to fire. An Illinois soldier later said he could not see even 20 feet ahead. Chaos and combat raged through Morgan's Woods all afternoon, as dense smoke from thousands of muskets obscured the darkening forest.

Jack Bower, private, 2nd Missouri Regiment The 16,000-strong Confederate Army of the West spent most of the first week of March 1862 trudging on muddy roads through northwest Arkansas. They traveled some 60 miles from their winter camps deep in the Boston Mountains, beyond the low ridges you see in the distance, to get to Pea Ridge. General Earl Van Dorn pushed his troops hard to sweep completely around his opponent, using a back road called the Bentonville Detour. Van Dorn gambled that if he could capture the Telegraph Road - the only pipeline for Union supplies and communications - he could crush the Union army. The mountain on which you are standing hid the Confederates' approach to the vital highway. The last night was the hardest. The cold was bitter.

As the late winter sunlight faded, Union troops pulled back from Elkhorn Tavern and prepared for a last-ditch defense along the tree line that bordered Benjamin Ruddick's cornfield below. Federal gunners set their cannon wheel hub to wheel hub and waited for the final massive Confederate assault. The white-clad soldiers of the Missouri State Guard who made that last charge were hungry and worn out by the three-day, 60-mile march they had made from the Boston Mountains.

Samuel Curtis, major general commanding, United States Army of the Southwest From this overlook you can see the great challenge facing General Samuel Curtis as two armies grappled on Pea Ridge - how to turn the 10,500 men in the Union army from facing south to facing north, while keeping his supply wagons from being captured. After night fell, Federal divisions that had fought at Leetown had to be brought together with the battered defenders astride the Telegraph Road you see below. Cold and hungry Union men who had marched most of the night had to be fed and issued fresh ammunition. Thousands of men and horses, hundreds of wagons, and dozens of cannons jostled along narrow country roads in the dark.

The park includes the ferry site where you are standing. The ferry was operated by the Jenkins' family prior to the Civil War and aided travelers on the Camden Road - a major travel route in pioneer Arkansas. In April of 1864, this site gained Civil War fame. Retreating from Camden to the safety of Little Rock, the Union Army was attacked by Confederate forces. General Frederick Steele used the ferry site as a bridgehead for spiriting his troops across the flooded Saline River and out of Confederate reach. Jenkins' Ferry, Marks' Mills and Poison Springs State Parks, and the 1836 Courthouse at Old Washington Historic State Park, which served as the Confederate Capitol of Arkansas at the time of the battle, are included in The Red River Campaign National Historic Landmark. Tablet #2 Red River Campaign (Battle of Jenkins' Ferry) Spring of 1864 saw war's violent hands seize southern Arkansas as Union leaders launched the Red River Campaign. Its purpose was to separate western Confederate forces from the east and to reopen access to Texas cotton. Union mistakes, heavy rain and floods, and strong Confederate resistance doomed the campaign to failure. On April 26, following such overwhelming defeats as Marks' Mills and Poison Springs, the Union VII Corps under General Frederick Steele pulled out of Camden heading north. General E. Kirby Smith's Confederate troops were less than 24 hours behind. The heavy Union wagons moved slowly as torrential rains turned the Camden Road into a quagmire. On April 29, Confederate infantry caught the Union army in the flooded white oak forest of the Saline River bottoms just south of Jenkins' Ferry. The battle raged for two days. Confederate forces mounted three major attacks but failed to halt the Union army's escape. Steele's troops managed to slip across the swollen Saline at Jenkins' Ferry on a mobile wooden bridge suspended by India Rubber pontoons. Once across, the bridge was sunk. Without a bridge, the Confederates could not follow. Bedraggled Union troops moved northward to higher ground where they burned many of their cumbersome wagons. The starving army then pressed on to Little Rock. The Campaign was over! The disastrous Red River Campaign was the Union's last major encroachment into south Arkansas. <small>BATTLE STATISTICS</small> Confederate 336 wounded 90 dead 1 missing Union 471 wounded 78 dead 40 missing Total 827 wounded 168 dead 41 missing Tablet #3 The Saline River Bottoms Found in the West Gulf Coastal Plain of southern Arkansas, Jenkins' Ferry Battlefield is on the banks of the free-flowing Saline River. The river's vast flood plain plays an integral part in the riverine ecology and in the history of the area. The damp, muddy canebrakes and wet marshes of this bottomland support abundant plant and animal life. Heavy rainfall and thick vegetation made travel difficult for settlers and nearly led to the destruction of Frederick Steele's Union Army in April of 1864. The heavy Union wagons bogged down in the flooded river bottoms south of the river. This gave the Confederates time to attack. Using an India rubber pontoon bridge, the Union Army was able to cross the river and escape."""

The Blues Trail: Mississippi to Helena,34.52283333,-90.58616667,History,"""Helena has played a vital role in blues history for artists from both sides of the Mississippi River. Once known as a &#8220;wide open&#8221; hot spot for music, gambling, and nightlife, Helena was also the birthplace of &#8220;King Biscuit Time,&#8221; the groundbreaking KFFA radio show that began broadcasting blues to the Arkansas-Mississippi Delta in 1941. The program had logged over 15,000 broadcasts by 2009 and inspired Helena to launch its renowned King Biscuit Blues Festival in 1986. (Side 2): The town emerged as a major center of culture and commerce in the Delta during the steamboat era and maintained its freewheeling river port atmosphere well into the mid-20th century. Cafes, night spots, and good-time houses flourished, and musicians flocked here to entertain local fieldhands, sawmill workers, and roustabouts who came off the boats ready for action. Many bluesmen ferried across the river from Mississippi or later motored across the Helena Bridge. Others came from elsewhere in Arkansas, up from Louisiana, or down from Memphis. Helena was at one time home to Mississippi-born blues legends Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson No. 2 (Rice Miller), James Cotton, Honeyboy Edwards, and Pinetop Perkins, as well as to Arkansas natives Roosevelt Sykes, Robert Nighthawk, Robert Lockwood Jr., Frank Frost, Jimmy McCracklin, and George &#8220;Harmonica&#8221; Smith, all of whom became influential figures in the blues. Williamson, Nighthawk, and Lockwood were among the first bluesmen to play their instruments through amplifiers, paving the transitional path of blues from acoustic to electric music&#8211;a development often attributed to Muddy Waters in Chicago in the late 1940s. Soon after KFFA went on the air on November 19, 1941, Williamson's broadcasts on &#8220;King Biscuit Time&#8221; brought blues to an audience that had seldom if ever heard such music on the radio. Up-and-coming bluesmen B.B. King, Albert King, Jimmy Reed, and Muddy Waters all tuned in to the lunchtime broadcasts from the KFFA studios, or on occasion from WROX in Clarksdale, advertising King Biscuit Flour and promoting their upcoming shows at local juke joints and house parties. The sponsor, Interstate Grocer Company, even introduced a Sonny Boy brand of corn meal. During Williamson's extended stays away from Helena, drummer James &#8220;Peck&#8221; Curtis kept the program going with an assortment of band members. The show eventually switched to records instead of live music and continued with deejay Sonny Payne at the helm. Off the air only from 1980 until 1986, it still ranks as one of the longest-running programs in radio history. The Delta Cultural Center began hosting the broadcast in the 1990s. The Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival, a favorite event among blues enthusiasts around the country, began as the King Biscuit Blues Festival in 1986, welcoming back former King Biscuit Entertainers Robert Lockwood and Pinetop Perkins for the first of many annual appearances, along with a variety of other acts including perennial local favorites Frank Frost, Lonnie Shields, Sam Carr, and CeDell Davis."""

KFFA 1360 Helena King Biscuit Time 'King Biscuit Time' first aired live on November 21, 1941, on Helena, Arkansas's KFFA 1360 AM radio. Since that time, the program has become the longest-running daily blues radio show in the United States, as well as an influential platform for up-and-coming blues performers. The award-winning program has aired more times that the 'Grand Ole Opry' and has outlasted 'American Bandstand' by at least a generation. Legendary bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson was the original host of King Biscuit Time, playing live with Robert Perkins and James Peck Curtis-in the KFFA studio. The show was named after King Biscuit Flour, distributed throughout the Arkansas Delta by Interstate Grocer Company. The company agreed to sponsor a radio production for Sonny Boy and his band in exchange for live commercials for King Biscuit Flour. King Biscuit Time was the first regular radio show to feature blues and has influenced generations of delta blues and rock n' roll artists whose sounds are based on the raw energy of Sonny Boy Williamson's music. The daily programming of Sonny Boy Williamson, Pinetop Perkins, Robert Jr. Lockwood, and other Delta blues legends laid the foundation for the blues, rock, pop, and hip-hop music of today. Award-winning 'Sunshine' Sonny Payne has hosted the show since 1951 and has been a presence on King Biscuit Time since its inception in 1941. A recognized blues musician in his own right, Payne welcomes visitors to the live broadcast each week at noon. In keeping with its tradition of broadcasting live music from the studio, King Biscuit Time still welcomes artists in the studio almost weekly, and the show's record-setting 15,000 plus broadcasts document the formation of a true American art form. Under Sunshine Sonny's direction, King Biscuit Time was awarded the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award in 1992, which recognizes outstanding achievement in the field of radio and broadcast journalism.

They were also required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which among other things guaranteed all male citizens 21 years and older the right to vote. <p> The 1868 Constitutional Convention Arkansas held a constitutional convention in 1868 to write a new constitution that satisfied the requirements set by Congress. Most former Confederates no longer had the right to vote. However, male Freedmen over twenty-one years of age did. For the first time, African American men helped write laws in Arkansas. Two of those men were William H. Grey and James T. White, Baptist ministers from Phillips County.<p> William Grey and James White James White and William Grey served as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Little is known about White, but Grey, who had never been a slave, took a very active role. He had worked for former Virginia Governor Henry Wise and understood how government worked. Grey was an outspoken advocate for the rights of Freedmen. 'We are here not to ask for charity at the hands of this honorable body, but to receive at the hands of the people of Arkansas, in Convention assembled, the apportionment of our rights,' he declared. <p> The New Constitution A new constitution changed Arkansas. It gave African Americans the right to vote, to serve on juries, serve in the militia, and to hold office. It established free public schools for all and provided for a state university.

When Sylvanus Phillips settled in the area in 1797, all indications of the flourishing native American civilization were gone. Helena, Phillips' daughter, was her namesake for this historic river town. Helena, which lies at the southern tip of Crowley's Ridge, is one of the oldest towns in Arkansas. It was an important river town during the Civil War, and the deadly 'Battle of Hell' was fought on July 4, 1863, when the Confederate forces attempted to take the town from Federal occupation. Their efforts failed miserably.

The point where DeSoto crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas is much debated, with credible evidence that he crossed south of Helena into what is now Phillips County, opposite Sunflower Landing.

She came with the Western Sanitary commission, an organization much like today's Red Cross. Her report on the military hospitals were grim. 'We found the hospitals at Helena, if they may be called hospitals, in a dreadful condition. The Methodist and Baptist Churches were crowded with very sick and severely wounded men.

Behind the tents was a wide cypress swamp, 'stagnant and green and deadly.' Aid workers brought healthy food, clean clothing and blankets to the camp but the discouraged men told them their efforts were useless. 'it is only question of time,' one said, 'your efforts will only prolong our suffering; we are all the same as dead men.'

Others followed. The nation unraveled. In the troubled months before and after the presidential election, the men of Phillips County formed seven militia companies, including the Yell Rifles and Phillips Guards. As war drew closer they prepared to defend, 'our equality in the Union, our social system, our property, and our liberties.' 'The Union of States may no longer be regarded as an existing fact.' Arkansas Governor Henry Rector, December 1860. Crisis in Little Rock In early February, rumors began to spread- the Federal government planned to reinforce the Little Rock arsenal. Secessionists in Helena urged the governor to take action. The Yell Rifles, Phillips Guards and other Delta militia marched to Little Rock, ready to take the arsenal by force. Hoping to avoid bloodshed, Governor Rector met with the arsenal commander, Captain James Totten. The badly outnumbered commander agreed to leave. Satisfied, the militia returned to the Delta. Leaving Helena After their return, Miss Emma Rightor, representing the young ladies of Helena, presented a flag to Capt. Joseph C. Barlow of the Phillips Guards. In late April 1861, the Phillip Guards and Yell Rifles left Helena to join the Confederate army. Arkansas did not leave the Union until May, but their Civil War had begun.

Flanked by the officer's quarters to the right and the enlisted men's barracks on the left, the parade ground was the center of life at the fort. &#8220;A broad gravel driveway around the grounds encompassed an inner circle and this was the parade ground  In the center  stood a tall flagstaff, from which dizzy height, &#8220;Old Glory,&#8221; flung its protecting folds to the breeze. Morning and evening to the salute of a cannon and the strains of martial music, the flag was raised and lowered.&#8221;-Mary Rutherford Cravens, recalling life at the second Fort Smith. Gate A When U.S. Army engineers designed the second Fort Smith in 1838, they provided strong fortifications in the form of a large stonewall. Although no military threats to the post ever arose, the wall remained in place until 1897. Today, the location of the wall is outlined by the continuous band of stone behind you. The gateway behind you, Gate A, served as the main gate between the post and the town of Fort Smith."""
"The Women's Jail, 1872-1888",35.388969,-94.429271,History,"""After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the guardhouse served the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas. It remained in use as a jail, detaining primarily women suspected or convicted of federal crimes until 1888. At that time, the court moved quarters for female prisoners into the courthouse/jail building. Although not as numerous as their male counterparts, female prisoners were no novelty in Fort Smith. They committed the same crimes as men in the Indian Territory, ranging from illegal sale of whiskey to murder. When convicted, they received the same sentences &#8211; fines, jail time or death by hanging. From 1873 through 1874 the guardhouse also briefly functioned as &#8220;Death Row&#8221; by holding the men condemned to die on the gallows."""
"The Guardhouse, 1849-1871",35.38903,-94.429346,History,"""The guardhouse, constructed in 1849, was a focal point of daily activity at the second Fort Smith. Not only did the men assigned to guard detail operate out of this building, but the officer of the day, who was responsible for the daily business of the post, worked out of an office located here. The guardhouse was also the place of confinement for soldiers under arrest for such offenses as drunkenness, desertion, or fighting. The Guard Mount, or changing of the guard ceremony, occurred here once a day usually about 9:00 a.m. At the time, the old guard detail would be inspected and mustered out, and the new guard detail would be inspected and mustered in. Members of the guard detail served as sentries throughout the fort grounds, at each gate, and watched prisoners in the guardhouse."""
The Flagstaff,35.388816,-94.429408,History,"""The U.S. Army built the original flagstaff at the second Fort Smith in 1846. As with many western military posts, the flagstaff stood tall so that its flag could be seen for miles. To attain a height of nearly 100 feet, the army joined two poles in the same way that ship masts were built. Historically, shroud lines attached to cross trees supported the area where the poles were joined, while guidelines and an underground wooden structure stabilized the base. When the army closed Fort Smith in 1871, they removed the flagstaff. The &#8220;Old Fort Militia,&#8221; a local citizen support group, in cooperation with the National Park Service rebuilt the flagstaff in 1984-85. Its 37-star flag is a replica of the last flag flown here by the army, from 1867-1871."""
The Bastion That Never Was,35.389037,-94.429869,History,"""When army engineers originally designed the second Fort Smith in 1838, they planned for it to withstand attack. A key feature in achieving this goal was a stone wall about twelve feet high and from two to three feet thick. This wall surrounded the buildings of the second fort. At the five corners of the wall the army intended to construct bastions, two-story fortified firing positions for cannons. Construction on this bastion began in March of 1839; by 1842 the foundation of the structure was nine feet high and five feet thick. Quartermaster General Thomas Jesup inspected Fort Smith in 1845 and ordered this fortification converted into a commissary depot. General Jesup's intervention led to Fort Smith's continued growth by shifting the mission of the post from defense to supply. With supply as its primary mission, Fort Smith became one of the largest and busiest posts in the southwest prior to the Civil War."""
The Commissary Storehouse,35.387619,-94.429082,History,"""This is the oldest building still standing in Fort Smith. Originally built as part of a larger fortification, over the years its appearance and use changed dramatically. The building held supplies used by explorers and soldiers, played a crucial role in two wars, and served as an office for Federal Judge Isaac C. Parker. Today the commissary is furnished with reproductions of supplies that the U.S. Army stored here in the 1850s. A number of posts located farther west benefited from these rations. As part of Fort Smith National Historic Site, the commissary building helps tell one dimension of Fort Smith's rich and varied history"""
Officer's Garden,35.388805,-94.430065,History,"""The walls were almost hidden by a wealth of vines and foliage, and the enclosed space was as green as nature and care could make it. Beautiful flower beds were kept well tended by the soldiers and added greatly to the beauty of the grounds.' Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling Fort Smith in the 1850s A garden provided many benefits to the soldiers and their families at Fort Smith. Fresh vegetables in the garden behind the officer's quarters provided a healthy addition to their daily diet. Herbs were used as seasoning and medicine. Flowers brightened an otherwise monotonous fort life. Working in the garden was part of the daily routine for officers' wives and children. The garden also served as a pleasant gathering place for friends and family."""
The Officer's Quarters,35.388311,-94.430564,History,"""You are now standing on what was once Officer's Row at the second Fort Smith. From 1846 to 1865, two large buildings stood on the western edge of the parade ground and provided housing for officers and their families. Unlike the cramped quarters of the enlisted men's barracks, there was a degree of privacy here. Large front and back porches, yards, and gardens surrounded by picket fences provided further domestic comforts. Fire destroyed both Officer's Quarters in 1865 and 1870. In 2000, the National Park Service placed the concrete pads here to show the approximate locations and floor plans of both buildings. The Cistern Following the Civil War, the U.S. Army constructed a dome-shaped cistern between the two officer's quarters. This underground storage tank is 22 feet deep and holds 55,000 gallons of water. The cistern, enlisted men's barracks and the commissary are the only structures remaining from the second Fort period (1838-1871). Captain Samuel Sturgis, Commander at Fort Smith, 1859-1861, Officer's wives and children shared the trials and tribulations of military life with their husbands and fathers. At Fort Smith, Sturgis' son, Jack was badly burned when two other boys accidentally exploded twelve pounds of gunpowder. Jack carried a facial scar until his death as a lieutenant at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876."""
Fort Wall,35.387792,-94.43076,History,"""Security has always been a concern for the U.S. military. The army designed the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) as part of a line of forts from Minnesota to Louisiana to separate the territory occupied by Native American tribes from that settled by American citizens. To provide protection in the event of an attack, military engineers called for the construction of a fort with five bastions (gun emplacements), and a massive stonewall that was 12 feet high and 2 feet thick. Fort Smith represents the last of a dying breed; from the 1840s on, virtually all frontier forts were built without walls. After Fort Smith was built, the cost of constructing a wall was considered too great in comparison to the benefit of a fortified defense. The fort walls remained in place throughout the federal court era (1872-1897), affording a level of security for proceedings and the executions that took place. Today the location of the original wall is outlined by continuous band of stones."""
Defending Freedom,35.387911,-94.430508,History,"""I never saw such fighting done as was done by the negro regiment The question that negroes will fight is settled; besides they make better soldiers in every respect than any troops I have ever had under my command. ~General Blunt after the Battle of Honey Springs, July 17, 1863.

Drills increased after Confederate soldiers mercilessly massacred black troops who had surrendered at Poison Springs in 1864. Many of the troops were former slaves. Later that year, the 11th USCT, on duty in Indian Territory, battled Confederate cavalry in one of many skirmishes fought by Fort Smith troops. By war's end about 10 percent of all Union troops were USCT regiments."""
The Gallows,35.387666,-94.430119,History,"""With the largest criminal jurisdiction of any federal court at the time, the Western District of Arkansas handled an extraordinary number of murder and rape cases. When a jury found defendants guilty in these capital cases, federal law mandated the death penalty. In Fort Smith, that meant an execution by hanging on a &#8220;crude and unsightly&#8221; gallows. A visitor to the city in 1893 recommended constructing a new gallows to evoke the &#8220;sacredness and majesty of the law.&#8221; This was never achieved and a year after the last execution, the city of Fort Smith destroyed the gallows structure. &#8220;I do not desire to hang you men.

With the Confederate victory in South Carolina at Fort Sumter, the U.S. War Department ordered all southern forts abandoned. Despite pleas of concerned citizens, U.S. troops (later called Union troops) left Fort Smith just an hour before state militia arrived. The transition took place without conflict. While Arkansas militia troops controlled the fort, citizens of Fort Smith and the surrounding region remained deeply divided. Many pro-Unionist kept silent, suppressed their loyalties, or left town.

Tribes were told their rights had been forfeited, their slaves must be freed, and their property could be confiscated. The Council ended with little resolved.

The Western District Courthouse,36.400845,-93.738786,History,""" Eureka Springs was incorporated on Valentine's Day in 1880. At that time, the only courthouse was in the county seat of Berryville, some 12 miles to the east. This was a great distance at the time, the roads were bad, and the King's River had to be forded if it was passable. As a result, the citizens of Eureka Springs petitioned for their own courthouse, and in 1883, the Arkansas General Assembly enacted legislation to create the Western Judicial District of Carroll County. In 1906 Claude A. Fuller was elected mayor of Eureka Springs. A rented room was being used as a courthouse and the town wanted a new one. The problem was to get the Quorum Court, composed of all the Justices of the Peace in the county, to approve an appropriation for the purpose of building the courthouse. The night before the matter of the appropriation was to come before the Court, Mayor Fuller discovered that two Justices of the Peace from the Western District of the county were absent, and he needed their votes. He telephoned the Chief of Police in Eureka Springs and instructed him to go out on horseback, leading two horses for the justices to use, and bring the absent ones in. The following morning at 5:00, the Chief of Police and the two reluctant justices rode into Berryville. When the Court met and the matter was put to vote, those two justices made it a tie. Tom Fancher, the County Judge broke the tie by voting for the appropriation, and that is how Eureka Springs obtained its courthouse. It was designed and constructed of native limestone by W.O.

Beatty in 1886, at which time it was acclaimed to be one of the city's two finest hotels, the other being Perry House, situated on the opposite side of the spring. Damaged in the Great Fire of 1890, The Southern was repaired and enlarged to one hundred rooms, gas lighted throughout, and boasting for a time an outdoor 'elevator' which lifted guests from Basin Spring level to hotel entrance. Wallace McQuerry owned the hotel in 1932 and had renamed it Southern Home. On November 12 that year this handsome wooden structure which stood for just over half a century was destroyed in what the Times-Echo and other newspapers described as 'a spectacular blaze.'"""

A Monarch Returns,36.0048,-93.3679,History,"""What an exciting discovery to come across an elk roaming the fields and woodlands of the Buffalo River country. Once again these large members of the deer family can be found grazing or resting in clearings and open spaces. Native to the hardwood forests of the Ozarks, an eastern subspecies became extinct by the 1840s. At the prompting of local citizens, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission re-introduced 112 Rocky Mountain elk along the Buffalo River in 1981. Although the elk adapted to their new habitat, parasites, poaching, and road kills have limited their population growth. Nonetheless, these majestic mammals appear to be extending their range in the Buffalo River region. Elk may weigh up to 800 pounds, compared to a 150-pound white-tailed deer. Elk Viewing Tips: Keep your distance. Elk are large, wild animals that can seriously injure you! Use binoculars or telephoto lenses for a better view.

The Stone Walls,36.402236,-93.737448,History,""" Eureka Springs claims an estimated fifty-six miles of stone walls. Skilled stonemasons constructed most of the walls between 1885 and 1910. The limestone used was sometimes quarried on site but the majority was transported to the town site by horse drawn wagons or railroad flatcars from the quarry near Beaver, six miles away and the railroad junction 2 miles north of Eureka Springs. In the first census of Eureka Springs in 1880, thirty men gave 'stonemason' as their occupation. They were drawn to the new town where construction of dwellings and commercial buildings went on all day and far into the night to keep up with demand. Stonemasons built mainly foundations and retaining walls for the early wood structures. Major fires in 1883 and 1888 brought about a change to stone and brick construction to safeguard against fire. In 1890, a project to improve and widen the town's main streets and beautify its public places resulted in building many miles of stone walls. This was a massive project as stonemasons constructed walls as much as twenty feet high along Spring, Howell and Main, the Boulevard and other streets. Walls were built on either side of the stream flowing down Main Street and connected by arched stone bridges. The best known wall builders in Eureka Springs during its first half century were James M. Waldrip and his sons, William, James and John. The Waldrip brothers built miles of walls and created finely crafted stonework to enhance several spring reservations under the directions of the Board of Public Affairs. Sam A. Leath, Chamber of Commerce Director, devised the estimate of 56 miles of walls about 1948 as a new era of tourism began. Ripley's 'Believe It or Not' features in newspapers, radio and television, illustrated the oddities of Eureka Springs more times than any other city, including '136 winding, twisting streets' and 'rock walls... miles and miles of them.' Since the 1970 designation of Eureka Springs as a National Register Historic District, more miles of walls have been built in restoration and preservation efforts. Stonemasons as skilled as those who first arrived in Eureka Springs in 1880 continue to create stone walls of great beauty and lasting quality."""

[Inset photo captions read] The earliest visitors to this place in the wilderness that would become Eureka Springs were here in desperate need of better health. Long known as a healing spring by Native Americans, the water was thought to cure all kinds of illness. Health-seekers flocked here in 1879, arriving on foot, horseback and in wagons. These were mostly poor people who had exhausted all other remedies. They lived in covered wagons, tents and rough shacks. Days were spent sociably walking from spring to spring with tin cups and water bottles to drink from each. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; By the 1890s Eureka Springs was becoming a fine spa resort. Basin Park had fine hotels on either side. The Southern Hotel on the south and The Perry House on the north. After The Perry House burned it was replaced with the Basin Park Hotel in 1905, the last of the big hotels. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; Since the 1880s, one of the landmarks of Spring Street has been the Flatiron Building.

It housed the town's first banking establishment and was the first structure made of brick among hundreds of wood buildings. The unusual three-sided, four story structure featured wood trim and a wraparound porch between second and third floors. In 1890 a fire began in the nearby Perry House Hotel which destroyed several buildings, including the Flat-iron. A second Flat-Iron was constructed on the site within a short time. The three-story building was made of brick with elaborate limestone ornamentation and a pressed metal cornice. In 1900 the building housed the Frisco Saloon with business offices and a lodge hall on upper floors. In 1925 the second Flat-Iron succumbed to fire. The brick and stone remains were taken down and the site stood vacant until 1989 when the third Flat-iron was constructed, incorporating architectural design elements of both previous structures"""

A Gun for All Reasons,34.78527778,-91.89972222,History,""" The 3-inch Ordnance Rifle was also known as the ordnance rifle, the ordnance gun, the Griffen gun, and was sometimes erroneously referred to as the Rodman rifle. The gun was invented by John Griffen, superintendent of the Safe Harbor Iron Works in Pennsylvania. His initial design was built by the Phoenix Iron Company of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, which manufactured most of the 3-inch Rifles used in the Union Armies. Griffen developed a process whereby strips of wrought iron 3/4 inches thick and 4 1/2 inches wide were wrapped around an iron core by a lathe. The tube was then heated and rolled to a length of seven feet before trunnions were welded on. Finally, a bore was reamed out. This process made the 3-inch Ordnance Rifle the lightest gun in field artillery service during the Civil War. Despite its light weight, the process of wrapping the wrought iron bands around the core made it the strongest, most durable gun in the field. The gun was deployed in support of infantry to repulse enemy assaults, often positioned behind the lines and fired over the heads of friendly troops. Range made the piece excellent for long-range shelling. Though its use was limited in wooded areas, it was accurate and lethal in open spaces. The rifle that stands before you was brought to the Lonoke County Courthouse before 1911 through the efforts of John Hallum, a soldier in the Civil War and a one time lawyer in Lonoke. Inset table of information U.S. M-1861 3-inch Ordnance Rifle Bore diameter 3 inches Tube composition Wrought Iron Length 73 inches Length of tube 69 inches Weight of tube 816 pounds Local stories about the rifle are that it was uned in the Brooks/Baxter War of 1874 and that it was taken from Federal forces and hidden in a bayou and nicknamed the Lady Furlow. It was restored in the 1920s in a blacksmith shop across from the courthouse. Little documented history of Rifle No. 705 can be found.

Inset table of information The Hotchkiss Shell (image actual size) Weight 9.5 pounds Powder charge 1 pound Range @ 5° elev. 1,830 yards Muzzle velocity 1,215 ft./sec. This projectile was invented by Andrew Hotchkiss of Sharon, Connecticut, and patented October 16, 1855. This particular example is without its sabot or concussion fuze or percussion fuze (two different fuzes.) The technology of rifled artillery also produced a new kind of projectile that could travel greater distances with a higher degree of accuracy. In addition to the Hotchkiss Steel Shell, a 3 Inch Shenkle round was used under certain circumstances.

Adjacent to it, twelve stair steps of dressed Beaver limestone lead to a public thoroughfare ten feet in width extending to Park Avenue on the hillside above.<p> Earliest view, an artist's sketch of Crescent Spring, published in 1881, shows a simple wood shed built to shade and protect the waters. The shed was replaced by an ornate wood gazebo with copper clad roof constructed by 1886. Wooden benches, a boardwalk and gas street lamps were in place by 1886, creating a beautiful promenade for resort visitors.<p> Crescent Spring and a reservation of the hillside above and on either side of the spring were set aside in the original plat of the town site surveyed August, 1979 [sic - 1879]. Named spring reservations around the 'principal springs', which included Crescent Spring, by name, were established by Ordinance No. 1, enacted April, 1880, upon the incorporation of Eureka Springs as a city."""

A Timeless Place,36.407452,-93.736618,History,"""<p> The buildings, the bluffs, the spring and The Boulevard all make this a special place in Eureka Springs which has kept a peaceful beauty of earlier times.<p> The front of the McLaughlin Block has changed little since it was built in 1900 to house a very modern grocery and meat market. Stone to construct the building was blasted out of the bluff and cut on-site. Congress Spring flows behind the building. An early writer describes the store: 'The grocery store was as clean, polished and sanitary as any drug store I ever saw. In those days there was not a fresh meat counter in every grocery store. Homer kept his hams, bacon and lard and bulky vegetables in a back room... which was a cavelike passage into the bluff, winding and widening until it furnished ample space for keeping butter and anything in his stock that required a low temperature.'<p> Before the library was built, there was an elegant gazebo marking the Spring Street entrance to the Crescent Hotel with a long stairway leading up. The stone gazebo stairway remains to create a grand entrance to the library. (The East Mountain Lookout is a replica of this gazebo.)<p> The Carnegie Public Library was completed in 1912 -- one of two remaining Arkansas libraries built with funds from Andrew J. Carnegie Foundation. The library still has its early charm and visitors are welcome inside. This view with the library in the middle shows a good example of the layering of buildings on the hillsides in Eureka Springs. Rising above are St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church and the Crescent Hotel.<p> This corner is still as charming as when it was 'improved' in the late 1880s. The spring gazebo was built in 1885 to replace a simpler one which burned. Landscaping, benches, street lights and sidewalks were also installed then to create a lovely promenade. The current-day Eureka Spring Preservation Society has restored historic street lamps to many of the springs.<p> In The Neighborhood First Presbyterian Church: Built in 1886 from donated stone left after the construction of the Crescent Hotel. The current congregation recently restored the unusual steeple.<p> Powell Clayton: He and his family lived next door. Former governor, senator and Union general, Clayton was one of Eureka Springs' most influential citizens. He was leader of the Eureka Improvement Company who brought in the railroad, built the Crescent Hotel and most of the infrastructure to make this town a fashionable spa resort in the 1890s.<p> The Boulevard: This was the name of Spring Street past Crescent Spring. It is lined with fine homes and cottages which abut the bluff on the west side and drop several stories below on the east. A short walk around the corner is a nod to prehistoric times, a Styracosaurus albertensis from local attraction, Dinosaur World, whose founder once lived in this house.<p> Trail: Note the steps for a walking path up to St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church (open for viewing) and the Crescent Hotel (also open to the public with a fine overlook on the fourth floor.)<p> Landmarks [Map and Key]<p> <small>This material is based upon work assisted by a grant from the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, a Preserve America grant.

Harding Spring,36.405548,-93.737274,History,"""<p> Named for J. Emmett Harding, a photographer who began the tradition of making photographs of people in front of the spring as souvenirs. He built a small dwelling near the spring in the summer of 1879.<p> In 1879, the spring was accessed by a narrow wagon track along a rocky ledge, leaving little room for gathering. Hand labor was required to move a great deal of earth to create a level area in front of the spring. A wide boardwalk and a wood stairway to the top of the cliff were built at that time.<p> Harding Spring is known as the site of one of the most famous healings in Eureka Springs. Twenty-year old Jennie Cowan had been blind for seven years following a severe illness. Jennie used the waters of Basin Spring for several months to no avail. She then began using the waters of Harding exclusively. On August 22, 1880, her sight was restored. Her exclamation 'I can see!' created an enormous sensation among the many people visiting Eureka Springs seeking the benefits of the healing waters.<p> Harding Spring is one of the original spring reservations established by Ordinance No. 80 dated February 16, 1886."""
Laundry Spring,36.400781,-93.734095,History,"""<p> The site of this spring was outside the area included in the 1879 survey. Known as East Mountain, this area was crowded with wood structures by 1885. The spring, which flowed from a small cave lined with projections of onyx stone, was already recognized for the healing waters.<p> Water made a stream down over the rock ledges to the creek below. The overflow of Little Eureka Springs, Cave Springs and others joined this stream further up the ravine. The spring overflow was very accessible and townspeople soon began to collect the water from below for household use. A wash house or laundry was established below the spring. In an early census, many women listed their occupation as a laundress.<p> The town's first government quickly passed an ordinance to protect all the springs. Circa 1880, Ordinance No. 10, Section 2: All persons washing their persons or clothes in or above the basins of all public springs shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.<p> The Riley survey of 1893 delineates the boundaries of a spring reservation. On August 4, 1903, an ordinance was enacted creating and describing Laundry Springs Reservation. The spring was known, however, from that date as Onyx Spring. All the onyx stone is reputed to have been taken for souvenirs over time.<p> In 1922, residents of East Mountain raised all the funds needed to employ carpenters Dillow and Bingham to make improvements around the spring.<p> They built a wood shelter over the cave opening. It was proudly boasted 'not a penny came from the city for these improvements.'<p> The Parks and Recreation Commission officially recognized the spring as Laundry Spring on October 8, 2003."""
Mud Street to Main Street,36.402649,-93.735908,History,"""<p> 'It being the first street in town... it was named Main Street. But owing to its low elevation and the law of gravitation, the water would find a level in the street, and as the immense travel created an abundance of mud, the street was nicknamed 'Mud Street' a name without music or elegance.' L.J. Kalklosch, The Healing Fountain, 1880<p> This long view shows North Main Street before the Great Fires when all the buildings were made of wood. Note the openness under the Grand Central Hotel which spanned the creek. In early days, this hotel was [used] as a stagecoach stop. Groceries were sold on the ground floor with lodging above. The wooden hotel burned in 1892 and was rebuilt in brick, billing itself as 'the only brick fireproof hotel in the city with Onxy Spring water on each floor.'<p> Right next to the Grand Central Hotel, Walker Brothers Department Store was a popular shopping place right up until the 1980s. The deep ravine next to it was covered with a large platform and used for special sales, rallies and other popular events.<p> This block is still intact from the early days when it was a hub for everyday needs. Messersmith's Grocery and Produce was on the corner with a barber shop next door. The block was anchored on the other end by Bergdorf's Grocers in a fine brick and stone building. This later became a center for the revival of pride in Ozark heritage led by sisters Edna Pike Bergdorf and Zoe Pike Harp and their husbands.

The Railroad Depot,36.413869,-93.733921,History,"""<p> The Eureka Springs Railroad opened in February, 1883. As the first trains arrived at the original station house, a finely crafted wooden structure, passengers were met by horse[-]drawn carriages and hacks which quickly carried them to the best hotels.<p> The railroad, an 18-mile line from Seligman, Missouri, connected to the Frisco railroad system and assured the success of the resort which could easily be reached from great population centers nationwide.<p> By 1900 the railroad was extended across Arkansas. By then named Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, the company ran eight to ten trains daily to Eureka Springs. In the year 1913 the original station house was taken down and replaced with a fine limestone structure which still stands.<p> Adjacent to the depot property stands the ruins of the Eureka Springs Electric Light and Street Railway Company, granted a franchise in May, 1891, to construct a power plant and provide electricity for private consumers and public street lighting. The company began the street railway that year and the system was operated by electricity in 1899. The limestone structure of massive size housed the power plant until destroyed by fire about 1930.

The Town that Water Built,36.411449,-93.733959,History,"""<p> First by horseback, wagons or on foot, invalids from all over this region flocked to Eureka Springs in 1879 to seek cures from the miraculous healing springs. But soon there were easier ways to arrive - stagecoaches, then trains. This laid a base for an early 'industrial park.'<p> Bringing railroad service through the rugged mountains and across the White River was no easy feat. A passage was blasted out of a cliff near Beaver, north of town, a high trestle bridge erected over the river, track laid over smaller creeks and rail bed cut out of bluffs along Leatherwood Creek.

An ice factory was added later. By 1908 it produced 4 tons of ice daily with 6400 sq. ft. of cold storage.<p> Almost as soon as the town began, Eureka Springs bottled and shipped water from the famous springs. The most enduring company was the Eureka Springs Water Company with their trade name Ozarka. As early as 1904, four train tanks of Ozarka Water from nearby springs were shipped out each week.

Clues from the Past,35.3883,-94.4295,History,"""The building in front of you is very much as it appeared in the 1890s. First used as a military barracks, it was later converted for use as a courthouse and jail. Over time its appearance changed to accommodate the different needs of the people using it. Between 1851 and 1887, the structure was 1 &#189; stories with large porches. The second story of the courthouse was added in 1891 for use as a hospital for the prisoners, and the long porches were removed and replaced with shorter ones. Historical accounts note that the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) had three water wells. The only one that has been located is under the circular patch of grass in front of you. Sheltered by the small gazebo visible in the photo, this well supplied water throughout much of the building's history. After 1870, the well was replaced by other water sources such as cisterns and water pumped from the river. Look at the historic photographs and compare them to the building you see today. Notice clues of its former appearance by examining bricked in windows, remnants of porch foundations, changing roof lines, and brick color variations."""
The Butterfield Overland Mail Route,36.453936,-94.015207,History,"""John Butterfield was born in Berne, New York in 1801 and grew up on a farm amid the technological revolution of the first steamboat, the Erie Canal, the steam locomotive, and the electric telegraph. In 1857, John Butterfield won a lucrative $600,000 contract that called for six years of semiweekly mail service to deliver the mail from St. Louis to San Francisco in 25 days. As soon as the contract was signed, 56 year old John Butterfield set out to complete a rapid survey of the route, taking a staff of helpers from four other express companies. He divided the route into 200 way stations and relay posts. During the year of preparation, Butterfield drove his men relentlessly, and spent more than a million dollars to get the mail route into operation. In September of 1858, they had the items listed at right ready to go. The Overland Stage Company continued to make two trips a week for 2 &#189; years. Each Monday and Thursday morning the stagecoach would leave Tipton and San Francisco on their transcontinental journey, conveying passengers, freight and up to 12,000 letters. The western fare one-way was $200 gold (equivalent to about $3,000 today), with most stages arriving at their final destination 22 days later. The nation's first trans-continental mail line passes through a future Civil War battlefield In 1858, when the first Butterfield Overland Mail coach stirred up the dust along this road while delivering mail to San Francisco, who would have thought that some four years into the future Union and Confederate artillery wagons would stir the same dust during a bitter Civil War. The first run of the Butterfield Overland Mail departed St. Louis, Missouri on September 16, 1858. The stage entered Arkansas sometime after midnight on Saturday September 18, 1858 a few hours later it passed the Elkhorn Tavern on its way to the first official stop at Callahan's Station about 8 miles from here and then on to Fayetteville, Arkansas which was reached at 11:00 a.m.. Although the Elkhorn Tavern was never an official Butterfield Station it is probable that brief stops were made to rest and water the horses. Twenty-three days and some 2,800 miles later, the stage and mail would arrive in San Francisco, California. This first west-bound mail stage also carried a distinguished passenger list including: Mr. And Mrs. John Butterfield, Judge and Mrs. John Wheeler and their two children from Ft. Smith, T.R. Corbin of Washington, D.C., and Waterman Lily Ormsby, a correspondent for the New York Herald Newspaper. Ormsby said of the trip to Fayetteville, &#8220;We kept traveling all day and night ... our way during Friday afternoon and evening being through extremely dusty, hilly and stony road ... This brought us to Callahan's, but twelve miles from Fayetteville ... We greased our wagon, changed horses, and got some breakfast &#8211; all in an incredible short space of time &#8211; after which we set out for Fayetteville.&#8221; After leaving Fayetteville, he wrote, &#8220;Even among these hills you do not lose site (sic) of the prairie nature of the West; for just after leaving Fayetteville, you see a fine plain, surrounded by Hills -- in fact, a prairie in the mountains. After a rather rough ride of 14 miles, which we accomplished with our excellent team of four mules to cross the much dreaded Ozark range, including the Boston Mountain. I had thought before we reached this point that the rough roads of Missouri and Arkansas could not be equaled; but here Arkansas fairly beats itself.&#8221; The Civil War brought a sudden end to the Butterfield Overland Mail. Despite its short life, the Butterfield Overland Mail was the first successful attempt to bridge the nation sea to sea. A correspondent's first journey through Arkansas Waterman Ormsby, a correspondent for the New York Herald, recalled the first journey through Arkansas: &#8220;We kept traveling all day and night. The route leads over those steep and rugged hills which surround the Ozark range in this section of Arkansas. At about 11 o'clock on Saturday morning, September 18, the mail entered Fayetteville and arrived at its station on College Avenue just across the street north of the old courthouse. Here the mail sack was opened and a small addition made. After a change of horses, dinner, and everything being ready, the coach left for Ft. Smith at 12 noon, twenty-two hours and 13 minutes ahead of schedule.&#8221; Fayetteville was a major stop. The route from Fayetteville through the rugged Boston Mountains to Ft. Smith required that the horses be exchanged for mules, animals that could better make the arduous trip. The trip must have been brutal traveling day and night and more than 100 miles a day. Ormsby remarked after his trip west, &#8220;Had I not just come out over the route, I would be perfectly willing to go back, but now I know what Hell is like. I've just had 24 days of it.&#8221;"""

"The Casualties at Ditch Bayou June 6, 1864",33.269536,-91.222135,History,"""The battle at Ditch Bayou was a Federal effort to drive Confederates away from the Mississippi River, where the Confederates had been harassing Union shipping. Even though the Confederates were outnumbered here, they were able to inflict heavy damage to their enemy. They had the advantage of six cannons, the protection of heavy timber and knowledge of the area. Muddy conditions caused the Northern infantry to attack across an open field without artillery support. After crossing the field under heavy fire, they discovered that they were trapped in the open field and were separated from the Confederates by Ditch Bayou. Union losses were 33 killed, 98 wounded, and one missing. Notice that their heaviest casualties were directly opposite the Confederate artillery. The Confederate losses included four killed and 33 wounded. Most of their casualties were in the artillery units where the Union troops concentrated their fire."""

To your front is Ditch Bayou, and 700 yards beyond that 3,000 troops under Union Major General A.J. Smith. Among them is the 8th Wisconsin with its mascot, Old Abe, the War Eagle. As the Union troops advance, the cannon thunder with grape and canister. The seasoned troops closed the gaps in their line and keep coming. They poured volley after volley toward their position. However, most of the Confederate troops are hidden in trees while the Union soldiers are caught in the open. The battle rages for six hours. The mile-long Federal line reaches the edge of the bayou. They have suffered high casualties, 132 killed, wounded, or missing. Federal losses would be higher had the black powder smoke not created a protective fog. Finally, ammunition dwindling, the Confederates make an orderly withdrawal and march past Lake Village. They have only four killed and 33 wounded. The Union troops bury their 33 dead on the battlefield and carry their wounded into town. Some of the seriously wounded men suffer for months until they die in a hospital.

Calif Spring,36.399476,-93.740892,History,"""<p> Calif Spring was originally called Table Rock Spring, named for the rock formation above the spring area. This area was set aside as a spring reservation in 1886 by City Ordinance. S. L. Calif established a residence and general store next to the spring, which he excavated and cleaned. He was given a 99 year lease on the land where his house was located. It was then referred to as 'Calif Spring.'<p> The odd round stone building in this park covers Calif Springs itself. It was built following a study done in 1921 by a national engineering firm which resulted in the development of a major water treatment program for the springs. The water was subjected to the ultra-violet rays of a mercury lamp enclosed in a quartz tube and operated by direct electric current. This treatment was used on five springs on Main and Spring Streets. Construction cost for Calif Spring was estimated at $260. Cost for electricity to operate all the systems was estimated at $600 per year - high for the 1920s. To pay for the project an ordinance was passed to create a Spring Improvement District and impose a tax assessment on each property in this District.<p> Spring Reservations Eureka Springs was founded upon the belief that there was healing for human ills to be found in the waters which flowed from the springs in the bluffs. From the earliest days, city government realized the need to protect and preserve these precious spring waters for the benefit of all. Thus, large tracts of open land on the hillsides around and above the springs were established by law as Spring Reservations. Most of these spring reservations are still in place.<p> How These Springs Work Eureka Springs has a karst geology which produces two distinct groundwater systems. The first unit is composed of the Boone Foundation which is a highly fractured limestone. It is extremely porous and up to 250' thick. Beneath this is a two-unit layer of St. Joe Limestone. The top unit is finely crystalline limestone which forms bluffs and when fractured, forms caves. It is 30-45' thick. The second unit is less resistant and forms slopes rather than bluffs. It is 12-24' thick.<p> Beneath these is a thin layer of Chattanooga Shale less than 1-10' thick. The shale creates an impermeable divider between the groundwater systems. Water flowing through the upper system cannot pass through the Chattanooga Shale, so it surfaces through the St. Joe limestone. The areas' valleys parallel the contour lines of the Chattanooga Shale, spreading the underground flow into many small springs.<p> Beneath the Chattanooga Shale are three more layers of rock. Sylamore Sandstone, 2-25' thick, Powell Formation, 20' thick and Cotter Formation, 150' thick. Water from these lower layers only appear where the Chattanooga Shale has been removed by erosion such as in Dairy Hollow and Leatherwood Creek.<p> More recent groundwater tracing has led to the discovery that the springs of Eureka Springs get their water from local sources - the areas where most residents live - not thousands of miles away.<p> [Photo and diagram drawing captions on left read] - Of the five springs, only Calif Spring still retains its stone treatment building.<p> - Springs Systems of Eureka Springs<p> Why You Can't Drink From The Springs Now The important aspect of these water systems is that the springs are recharged by rainfall. They have a rapid response to heavy rainfall indicating that the groundwater systems are composed of channels. There is little soil contact which limits natural filtration. Thus, settlement around the spring recharge areas is the reason the spring water is no longer drinkable. The ever shifting karst terrain causes the water and sewer pipes to fracture. Their contents then leak into the groundwater system channels and come out in the springs. Even though the water in the spring still looks clean and pure, it is contaminated."""

Revolutionary War,36.433481,-94.229765,History,"""<p> The American Revolution was a conflict between England and thirteen of her colonies in North America. Following years of taxation, suppression, and subjugation by the British, fighting began at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts in 1775. A scant two months later the British attempted to break the colonial siege of Boston, and the Battle of Bunker Hill took place, but the gallant American defense heightened the colonists['] morale. It was immediately preceding this battle that the phrase, &#8220;Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes&#8221;, was heard. The Declaration of Independence was declared in July 1776. Small and fragmented American Naval forces made crucial contributions to the war's success. They captured enemy merchant ships and provided vitally needed supplies to General Washington's Army.<p> [Image] Battle of Bunker Hill<p> In many respects, the year 1777 was the most critical year in our young nation's history. The Saratoga Campaign identified the Green Mountain Boys (Vermont and New Hampshire) and Colonel Daniel Morgan's Sharp Shooters (Virginia), both elements were active in the victory at the Battle of Bennington. Many consider this campaign to be the most decisive of the war; not only did it encourage the patriots, but it induced the French to fully join the cause. Meanwhile, General Washington established his main camp at Valley Forge near Philadelphia in the winter of 1777-78. His army had dwindled by half to some 10,000 and these were held together by their loyalty to Washington and the patriotic cause. Two distinguished foreigners, General Lafayette and General von Steuben drilled and organized the men, transforming them into a cohesive and integrated military force.<p> [Image] Valley Forge<p> Operations in the south were keeping pace with those to the north. Some historians have described the strategy of patriot Generals' Greene and Morgan as brilliant. Greene's ability to draw General Cornwallis away from his base in Charleston, South Carolina up into North Carolina was vital to the successful southern campaign. General Morgan's astounding victory at the Battle of Cowpens was a skillful tactical accomplishment. The British lost 100 killed (including 39 officers), 230 wounded, and 600 captured to 12 patriots killed and 61 wounded. General Morgan is the same person who commanded the Virginia Sharp Shooters in the successful Saratoga Campaign. It has been stated that General Greene was defeated tactically in nearly every battle, but his campaign was a strategic success from start to finish.<p> [Map showing] &#8220;The American Revolution &#8211; Denoting Achievement, Expressing Greatness, and Signifying Independence&#8221;"""
Lewis & Clark Expedition,36.433481,-94.229765,History,"""<p> The Lewis & Clark Expedition was accomplished by Captain Meriwether Lewis, Captain William Clark, and their fellow explorers, and was the visionary journey of President Thomas Jefferson. The journey was to become one of America's greatest adventure stories. Remarkably, while plans for the travel were being made, the Louisiana Purchase became a reality. In 1803 Jefferson obtained approval from Congress to form a small Army unit to explore the Missouri and Columbia Rivers. The small discovery unit, consisting of some 30 Army personnel and 15 boatmen and woodsmen, began their journey near St. Louis, Missouri in 1804. They spent the winter of 1804-05 in North Dakota, where they hired a French fur-trader as interpreter, who married a Shoshone Indian maiden named Sacagawea. She was to become an important asset to the expedition.<p> In the spring of 1805, having divested itself of the boatmen, the expeditions' [sic] roster showed 2 Captains, 3 Sergeants, 23 Enlisted Men, 2 Interpreters, Clark's man York, and Sacagawea with infant son. They departed North Dakota with six canoes and two pirogues. In Montana, the explorers were faced with their first long portages. Attaching cottonwood wheels to the heavily loaded canoes they were able to negotiate the steep banks and complete the long traverses on the prairie. In July 1805, the expedition reached the vicinity of the Continental Divide, near the tribal lands of the Shoshone. Here the expedition determined its need for horses for riding and as pack animals. Sacagawea's service as intermediary was essential in the succesful negotiations with the Indians. In September, the half-starved expedition reached the village of another friendly Indian tribe, the Nez Perce. Here they built new canoes and left their horses in the care of the Nez Perce.<p> They entered the Clearwater River in mid September, reached the Snake River in early October, and on October 16 they reached the Columbia River. Despite savage winds, squalls, and ocean swells in the estuary, they finally walked the sands of the Pacific in mid-November 1805. Their unprotected exposure to the fierce winter storms and lack of game forced them to find winter quarters. These they found near present day Astoria, Oregon, naming the site Fort Clatsop for their Indian neighbors. Lewis & Clark began the return journey in March 1806. During the winter, the men hunted for food and made clothing from elk skins. The Captains worked on their journal entries: Lewis filled his journal with descriptions of plants, mammals, birds, fish, and Indian culture. Clark drew illustrations of animals, plants, and made maps. On September 23, 1806 the expedition arrived back in St. Louis. The explorers had covered nearly 8,000 miles in two years, four months, and ten days.<p> [Map caption reads] 'Following in the Steps of Captains Lewis and Clark'"""

One of the war's darkest hours was the British invasion of Washington, and the burning of the Capital [sic] and the White House. However, following Commodore Perry's success on Lake Erie and General Harrison's victory at the Battle of the Thames River, American dominance was restored in the northwest region. Exhausted by the continuance of the Napoleonic Wars, England negotiated the Treaty of Ghent in 1814.

Santa Anna's army began arriving in late February 1836 about two months after the loss at Bexar, and he gradually built up his forces over the next few days. Meanwhile, the Texans, under the command of Colonel William B. Travis, had fortified a former Spanish Mission called the Alamo. On March 6, after periodic bombardment, the Mexicans stormed the Alamo Fortress.

The War Between the States,36.433591,-94.229827,History,"""<p> The immediate cause of the War Between the States was the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States in 1860. The deeper cause, however, was the issue of states' rights. The question of states' rights was based on the belief that the United States was a union of independent commonwealths, and that the general government was merely their agent. Thus, when matters could not be resolved, the South felt free to assert their independence and form a new government. The North, however, assumed that Federal Government to be supreme, believed the Union to be one and inseparable, and secession to be a violation of the national compact.<p> In 1861 Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, igniting a war between the states. Heavy casualties in the early battles of the war shattered both sides' illusions that the war would end swiftly. Lincoln ennobled the war in 1863 when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The proclamation did not free any slaves immediately, but it gave the war a high moral purpose.<p> The two most decisive actions of the war occurred in July 1863. The battle of Gettysburg began on July 1 when Confederate forces encountered Union cavalry near the sleepy Pennsylvania town. The three-day battle produced staggering losses: 23,000 Union men and 28,000 Confederates were killed or wounded. After the battle, the Confederates gave up any hopes of invading the North and turned back to Virginia. While the Army of the Potomac was destroying Confederate hopes at Gettysburg, Union forces fought to gain control of the Mississippi River by laying siege to the Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederacy would never recover from the loss at Gettysburg or the surrender of Vicksburg.<p> After four years of bloody warfare, the recognized end of the war came with the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia to Union forces at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, in April 1865. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; The Gettysburg Address November 19, 1863<p> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.<p> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.

War with Spain,36.433591,-94.229827,History,"""<p> There were two principal causes for the war with Spain. The first was the brutality of the methods by which the Spanish Colonial authorities sought to suppress the revolution that began in Cuba in 1859 - methods that outraged the American sense of morality. The second was the mysterious explosion on the battleship USS Maine, which occurred on February 15, 1898, while on a goodwill visit to Havana. Investigations after the war concluded the explosion was accidental, but at the time almost everyone assumed that the Spanish had destroyed the ship. In April America declared war on Spain. The American Army landed some weeks later, and following the Battle of Kettle Hill the Spanish surrendered. As a result of this four-month long war, the United States gained the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Fierce fighting continued in the Philippines for another four years, however, before the insurgency there was brought under control.<p> [Illustration caption reads] The Rough Riders"""
World War I,36.433591,-94.229827,History,"""<p> 'The war to end all wars' began following the assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary in the summer of 1914. Before the summer was over Great Britain, France, Russia, and their allies were at war with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their allies. Despite its invasion of France, the [C]entral [P]owers were unable to capture Paris; and were forced to entrench north of the Marne River. There followed years of trench warfare which would only end with the cessation of hostilities.<p> In 1914 most Americans wanted to stay out of the fighting. However, cultural and economic ties with the western European Allies, and anger at Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare brought the United States into the war in April 1917. For a short period of time Americans served as replacements for allied casualties, but General Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary Force[s], believed in aggressive combat and felt that three years of trench warfare had made the allies too defensive, changed that protocol. Thereafter American soldiers fought as an independent force.<p> During May 1918 the Germans launched their spring offensive and smashed to within fifty miles of Paris. The Americans helped stop the German advance at Cantigny, and several weeks later played a major role in throwing back German attacks at Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Wood. In July and August they helped win the Second Battle of the Marne River. In September the Americans mounted offensives against the enemy at Saint Mihiel, and, in the largest American action at Meuse-Argonne. The Germans requested an Armistice in October. On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, the guns fell silent, and the world was at peace.<p> American Casualties<p> Deaths 116,515 Wounds 204,002<p> [Illustration captions read] Two Down to Glory The Highest Possible Courage"""

Great new technologies such as the family automobile, talking pictures, radio, and commercial air service were being woven into American lives. Compared to pre-war standards Americans were confident and prosperous. Suddenly in October 1929 the bottom fell out of the stock market, precipitating the Great Depression. At the same time a new president started America on the road to recovery in 1932. By then Italy and Japan had started to invade other countries, and Germany was soon to follow an aggressive military policy. By 1939 Great Britain and France were at war with Germany, and through the Lend-Lease Program the United States began to build and ship war materials to our allies. Following the 1940 election, American industry began a steady growth, and with the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States became the greatest industrial nation in the world."""
Triumph in Europe,36.433591,-94.229827,History,"""<p> Following World War I, the United States remained isolated from world affairs as economic and political factors led to the rise of nationalistic powers in the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Japan. A series of bold moves by Germany and weak countermoves by Allied leaders triggered World War II in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. Hoping to remain insulated, the United States provided aid to nations resisting the Axis Powers, but was drawn into the war when Japan launched her surprise attack on America's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. President Roosevelt proclaimed '...December 7, 1941 a day that will live in infamy...'. On December 8 Congress declared war on Japan. Germany and Italy declared war on the United States three days later.<p> The Allies agreed that the liberation of Europe would be their first priority. Beginning with the invasion of Africa in November 1942, the Allies then invaded Italy, through Sicily, in the spring of 1943. Despite Italy's surrender that summer, stubborn German resistance prolonged the fighting in Italy until the very closing days of the war. The awesome Normandy Invasion began the morning of June 6, 1944 and was followed by the liberation of France. As 1944 drew to a close, German forces launched their last desperate offensive known as the Battle of the Bulge. With staggering losses German forces began defensive actions on German soil. Finally, on May 8, 1945 Germany surrendered. The war in Europe was over, but the war with Japan in the Pacific continued.<p> [Illustration caption reads] Battle of the Winter Line - Italy<p> [Map of Europe]"""

More than 60,000 served as nurses in the Army Nurse Corps. Of this number more than two hundred died, sixteen were killed by enemy action, sixty-eight became prisoners, and many were decorated for bravery. The majority of Navy nurses served state-side, although some were caught up in the Bataan/Corregidor fighting. Approximately 150,000 women served in the Army (WACS), about 100,000 women served in the Navy (WAVES), and the Marines and Coast Guard each had its own womens' service element.

Throughout the world it is estimated that the total of military and civilian deaths amounted to over 53,000,000. In the countries where battles were fought millions of people were left homeless and entire cities and towns had to be rebuilt.<p> MATERIAL COST: The United States lost 59,000 aircraft, 157 naval vessels and 866 merchant ships.

By the summer of 1942 Japan controlled huge portions of Asia and the Pacific. Fortunately for the United States, the Pacific Fleet's submarines and aircraft carriers were not destroyed by the Japanese sneak attack. By the middle of 1942 America had stopped Japanese expansion in the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway and Guadalcanal. The strategy of island hopping to avoid enemy strongholds was adopted, though not all could be evaded. Before the war would end the American Armed Forces would count at least twenty-one major campaigns, engage in over thirty-six battles, and conduct countless sea-to-land assaults. As the Allies pushed closer to the Japanese homeland the landings became bloodier.

A typewriter company produced machine guns, and auto plants produced bombers. Millions worked in these plants, and with so many men in the armed forces 6.5 million women eventually became factory workers. It has been stated, and probably correctly, that without the United States industrial production the war would have been lost. Everyone felt the change as normally abundant consumer goods were rationed. All metals were needed for the production of ships, planes, guns, and ammunition. Gasoline needed to propel all sorts of military equipment was in short supply. Used cooking oils were recycled to make glycerin for explosives.<p> The disappearance of some color dyes was most evident when the dark green used on Lucky Strike cigarette packaging was changed to white, and the company's ads proclaimed 'Lucky Strike Green Has Gone To War'.

Cold War,36.433533,-94.229991,History,"""<p> The Cold War was a period of East-West competition, tension, and conflict short of full-scale war. It was characterized by mutual perceptions of hostile intention between military-political alliances or blocs. Quoting from a Veterans of Foreign Wars publication, 'By definition the Cold War would seem to exclude the concept of combat. And for 45 years of its duration, this fiction was maintained----'. 'The cold fight to contain communism worldwide (which excludes the full-fledged wars in Korea and Vietnam) involved numerous hostile encounters and claimed the lives of at least 359 Americans.' After Premier Stalin's death, East-West relations went through alternate phases of relaxation and confrontation. A final period resulted in the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the international symbol of East-West confrontation, in November of 1989. It was during this latter period that independence for former USSR republics as well as arms reduction led to increased cooperation between the two powers."""

Other acts of terrorism occurred over the next two decades. Most notable of these were the atrocity in Somalia, the tragedy at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and the attack on the USS Cole. However, America was unprepared for the acts of terrorism on September 11, 2001, when hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing thousands. Amidst their shock and sorrow, Americans also found strength and unity.

Sparks estate built the 1,200 seat New Theatre in 1911. Designed as a Beaux Arts style playhouse by Kansas City architect Carl Boller, modeled after the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City. The lavish interior featuring a proscenium stage was ideal for vaudeville shows and silent movies with orchestral accompaniment.

In the spring of 2001 Leonard Eisert, one of the founding Directors, presented the idea for a monument to a group of six (6) interested veterans. Out of that meeting was formed the Veterans Council. The Veterans Council of Northwest Arkansas was incorporated in the State of Arkansas in 2001 and is a tax exempt 501(c)3 organization. The Council broke ground on October 1, 2003 and dedicated this impressive structure on November 6, 2004 before a huge crowd headed by the late Lt. Governor Winthrop Rockefeller.<p> A visitor, after passing under the massive arch, will note the 36-foot time line, displaying major military events from 1776 to 2006. On the walls to the right and left rear, one finds 63 bronze historical plaques summarizing events displayed on the time line. The monument is circled by 18 historical flags. As the visitor proceeds inside, he sees the beautiful fountain and is amazed by the 4,167 incised veterans' tablets mounted on the 24 walls. One of the major objectives of the Veterans Council is to inform school groups and the general public of the contributions made by our veterans to secure our nation's freedoms. The Council is also a partner in the Veteran's History Project sponsored by the Folklife Center in the Library of Congress.<p> Architect's Statement The architectural process enables man's primal need to create forms that outlive us. Forms that reflect and honor the human purpose and celebrate the constant renewal of our existence.<p> This monument employs the circular enclosure as the form that historically has offered safe keeping for those contained within and currently for those honored here.<p> The introduction to this monument is through an entrance arch where the visitor is directed toward three concentric circular walls. Walls disposed to reveal in sequence: a time line of military events from the country's inception to the present, a graphic elaboration of those events, and a graphic review of military symbols and inceptive statements.<p> Granite tablets containing engraved names and service reference of these veterans are mounted on the inner face of all circular walls. Focus of the tableau is directed to the central gathering area where visitors can reflect on the service and sacrifices made throughout our military history. The visitor-observer then becomes the observed by that focus, becomes one with those honored and accepts their dedication as his own.<p> A bubbling fountain at the center of the gathering area suggests a constant vigil preserving and protecting the process and spirit of our free society  Leonard V.

The newspaper gave periodic updates of the rock walls going up and giving thanks that the 'wretched rookeries' on this corner were being replaced by the 'fine rock business house' being erected by those 'two young and successful enterprising merchants, Vogel & Wallace.' Business was so good that Vogel & Wallace moved to a new location in the 500 block of Garrison Avenue in 1883.

A favorite event for Lowell teenagers was coming to the depot to see the train go by or who got off. Toby Tucker was the mail messenger for years, meeting the train night and morning. If it needed to stop, he signaled by waving a kerosene lantern, otherwise, a mail crane held the mail pouch track side where the train 'snagged it' and kept moving on. Heavy incoming mail pouches were kicked or tossed off, at the precise moment, for Toby to take to the Post Office.

Personal knowledge places a post office north of the Lowell Bank in 1929, downstairs in IOOF building in 1949, and later south of that building, where Electric Company is in 2009. The next move was to the north end of the present Fire Department. Lowell's rapid growth soon required a larger building. It moved two doors west of the railroad crossing on Monroe Street.

The Bank of Lowell,36.257441,-94.131455,History,"""<p> Humphrey Barr, brother of Mrs. L. P. Davis, was an early banker. We know Henry Neal was the banker in 1918. He loaned Elza Tucker's mother $75 to buy a family sewing machine. He charged 10% interest and had a loan limit of $100. Elza has the receipt dated the same year he was born. Bank transactions moved at a steady but cautious pace for several years. That pace changed quickly in 1929 when the bank was robbed. Jude Austin tells, in his 'Lowell Memories,' how he was locked in the vault. That vault is still in place in 2009. Tin wall and ceiling tiles are still intact inside the upper part of the building, too.

In 1831, Lockhart was named postmaster of the new Saline Crossing post office and was granted exclusive rights to build a toll bridge. Other settlers began to move into the area but preferred higher ground and established Benton in 1833. Quapaws About December 19, 1825, the Quapaw Tribe numbering 455 passed where you are standing along to new homes. In 1824 the Quapaws had signed a treaty giving away the remainder of their tribal land in Arkansas Territory for land among the Caddo Tribe on the Red River in Northern Louisiana. Government agent Antoine Barraque and Chief Heckaton led the emigration. Conditions proved disastrous for the Quapaws in their new home and they again passed here returning to an area near their old homes between June 1827 and 1830.

About 300 Chickasaws led by Chief Samuel Sealy refused to go any way other than to cross the Arkansas and start south down the trail. Millard went with the steamboat party and then returned to Little Rock. On August 10, 1837, Millard started down the Southwest Trail in search of Sealy's party. He found some had only traveled five miles. As Millard traveled along he collected more and more of the Chickasaws. By August 12, 1837 he was getting close to this site.

Cadron Blockhouse,35.10397,-92.54492,History,"""The blockhouse is a replica of a structure that was built on this site in the late 18th century. The building was a multiple use structure, but constructed originally for defense purposes. It was used as a trading post, as a residence, and as a public gathering place. When the French trappers and other early settlers were in this area, the Osage Indians occupied the land north of the Arkansas River. When the Osage were on the warpath, the settlers used the blockhouse as a place for refuge. The blockhouse is refered to in some of the French and Spanish journals and other early records. In the early 1800's the John McElmurry Family owned the property and occupied the blockhouse as a residence. The reconstruction was a joint venture of the Conway Chamber of Commerce and the Faulkner County Historical Society in cooperation with the U.S. Corps of Engineers.

DeValls Bluff Under Fire,34.784178,-91.458712,History,"""DeValls Bluff's status as an excellent riverport and the head of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad made it an important base for both Confederate and Union forces. Hoping to block Federal ships from moving up the White River, Major Gen. Thomas C. Hindman fortified the site in June 1862 with two 8-inch guns, 1,000 infantrymen and 250 cavalry. Union troops skirmished with Confederate horsemen near DeValls Bluffs on July 6, but did not enter the town. After the battle of Arkansas Post in January 1863, a joint Army-Navy expedition steamed up the White River to attack Confederate positions. They arrived at DeValls Bluff on January 16 and captured the two 8-inch guns, 25 prisoners, dozens of new Enfield rifles, and other Confederate equipment. The Union troops burned the depot, several railroad cars and two railroad bridges. On August 10, 1863, another Union flotilla approached DeValls Bluff, surprising 12 Confederates who fled, leaving their equipment behind. Major General Frederick Steele's Union army occupied the town on August 23, and DeValls Bluff remained under Federal control for the rest of the war. Because of the concentration of Union troops there and on the adjacent prairie, Confederate cavalrymen who continue to attack Union targets &#8212; including the railroad &#8212; well into 1864.

Why DeValls Bluff,34.784275,-91.458732,History,"""DeValls Bluff was ideally situated to be an important location in the Civil War. The riverport was located at a point on the White River that was navigable at all seasons, a distinct advantage over Arkansas River sites that were frequently isolated by low water. DeValls Bluff also was the head of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad, which ran from there to present-day North Little Rock. Thus, people and supplies could be shipped by steamboat to DeValls Bluff, then transported by train to the capital at Little Rock. Union troops occupied DeValls Bluff in late August 1863 during the campaign to capture Little Rock, and it became a major supply depot for the remainder of the war. While the heavily fortified town itself never faced serious attack, the railroad line was a frequent target for Confederate raiders. DeVall's Bluff Through The Soldiers Eyes &#8220;White River is at present a better one for the purpose of navigation than the Mississippi; it is falling now, but will rise again next month, and can be depended upon all the time for over 4 feet of water to this point   No pilot is required. All that is necessary is to keep a boat from running on the banks. With such a base as this, it will be a very easy matter to carry on operations against Little Rock.&#8221; Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele DeValls Bluff August 23, 1863. &#8220;This is a splendid sight for a town, and if in any of the Northern states, in as fine a country with a railroad connecting it with the interior and the best river for navigation in the United States of its size running past it, would have been a city of 25,000 inhabitants.&#8221; Capt. Edward Redington 28th Wisconsin Inf. Regiment August 20, 1863"""
War on the White River,34.784206,-91.458897,History,"""With a swift current and deep channel that allowed deeper-draft vessels to use it reliably as far north as Batesville, the White River was the most important river in Civil War Arkansas and was used extensively by both sides. The Confederate gunboats Pontchartrain and Maurepas moved up the White following the defeat of the Confederate fleet at Memphis on the Mississippi River on June 6, 1862. The Maurepas remains in the White River, scuttled at St. Charles. The Union navy patrolled the White River from the fall of 1863 until the end of the war. Using DeValls Bluff as a base, they often emerged in cat-and-mouse operations against Confederate troops and guerrillas in the area. Major Activities Along the White River On June 13, 1862, a Union fleet left Memphis to bring supplies to Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis's Army of the Southwest via the White River. On June 17, 1862, they encountered Confederate batteries at St. Charles, where a Rebel shell pierced the steam drum of the U.S.S. Mound City, scalding dozens of sailors to death. That artillery shell, called &#8220;the single deadliest shot of the Civil War,&#8221; caused 7 percent of the total fatal casualties suffered by the Union navy in the entire war. Falling water levels forced the flotilla to fall back without reaching Curtis. A Union Fleet used the White River Cutoff to enter the Arkansas River and crush the Confederate base at Arkansas Post January 9-11, 1863. On January 12, a joint Army-Navy expedition headed up the White River in pursuit of Confederate steamboats. They captured and partially burned St. Charles, destroyed Rebel supplies at DeValls Bluff, and captured and paroled 39 sick Confederates at Des Arc before returning downriver on the 19th. A Union flotilla met Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele's army at Clarendon on August 9, 1863, during Steele's drive to capture Little Rock. Part of the fleet advanced up the White River on August 12 to burn a warehouse full of Confederate supplies at Des Arc and briefly occupy Augusta, while the remainder moved up the Little Red River to capture a pair of steamboats. Confederate General J.O. Shelby operated in the area along the White River throughout the summer of 1864. On June 24, 1864 his cavalrymen slipped into Clarendon and found the U.S.S. Queen City at anchor. Shelby attacked and captured the vessel, sinking her after seizing supplies and weapons. A punitive expedition steamed down the White the next day, but the elusive Shelby slipped away. Union gunboats escorted Yankee infantrymen up the White on August 30, 1864, in pursuit of Shelby's Confederates. They advanced as far as Augusta, facing frequent sniping from gunmen along the shore, before returning to DeValls Bluff on September 6. &#8220;The country along the bank [of the White River] is ... the wildest that I ever saw, being low-land covered with heavy forest of timber with cotton wood and cane underbrush ... I know not how circumscribed the limits of civilization in our enlightened land are, but I am inclined to believe from all manifestations that this part of Ark. is not found within her borders.&#8221; Sgt.

Common Ground for Many Soldiers,34.784151,-91.458906,History,"""With the possible exception of Helena, it is unlikely that any place in Arkansas had as many Union troops pass through it as did DeValls Bluff. Some saw the town when it was first occupied in September 1863, others stood garrison duty there, while still others visited DeValls Bluff before embarking on raids and expeditions into other parts of Arkansas or Missouri. Thanks to Frederick Dyer's Compendium of the War of the Rebellion, we can compile a list of Union units that might have, however briefly, called DeValls Bluff home. Confederates in DeValls Bluff Confederate units that used DeValls Bluff are more difficult to identify since their records are sketchier and there is no Dyer's Compendium for the Confederacy. Still, it is likely that many Regiments passed through the town during 1861 and 1862, heading east to fight with Confederate armies on the far side of the Mississippi River. As many as 6,000 Confederate troops assembled around DeValls Bluff in June and July of 1862 to oppose Union troops moving up the White River. Still others passed through in the months before it became a permanent, strategic Union base. Several Texas units occupied DeValls Bluff. These include the 9th Field Artillery Battery, 9th Texas Infantry Regiment, 10th Texas Infantry Regiment, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 17th Cavalry Regiment, and 18th Infantry Regiment.

DeValls Bluff: A Key Union Base,34.784164,-91.458951,History,""" DEVALL'S BLUFF, ARKANSAS August 23, 1863. GENERAL: Having reconnoitered the different routes, I have decided to commence my line of operations at this point, and have moved the depot and hospital here to-day. The site chosen is a plateau (oak opening), high bluff on the river, and sloping on both sides, on one side a deep ravine. The two gunboats which are to remain here can defend the flanks, and an intrenchment can be thrown up in rear which will make the place tolerably secure against any force that will be likely to annoy us while we are pushing the enemy to the front. The buildings here do not amount to much, but there is considerable lumber, and, by sending to Clarendon for more, we can erect tolerable shelter for the sick and the supplies. &#8212; Major General Frederick Steele With this report, DeValls Bluff began its role as a major Union base of operations. Steele's men soon built fortifications, a hospital, and a supply depot to support the Union army's drive to capture Little Rock. Once Union troops occupied the Arkansas capital, they had to be supplied &#8212; army regulations specified that Steele's men should be issued 20 tons of rations every day, in addition to the 120 tons of fodder his 24,000 horses and mules would need daily. The best way to bring these mountains of supplies to the U.S. soldiers was via the White River, where they could be stored in warehouses constructed in DeValls Bluff before the railroad would take them to Little Rock. Dozens of storehouses, hospitals, and other government buildings were soon built, some using lumber taken from buildings in Des Arc. As the war progressed, thousands of Union soldiers were stationed in DeValls Bluff to protect those supplies and the railroad that carried them, as well as to conduct operations against Confederate troops and guerrillas in the surrounding area.

The Memphis and Little Rock Railroad,34.786096,-91.458054,History,"""On the eve of the Civil War, the Memphis to Little Rock Railroad had completed a line between Hopefield across the Mississippi River from Memphis and Madison in eastern Arkansas. A second section between DeValls Bluff and the north side of the Arkansas River across from Little Rock was finished by January 1862. These were the only rail lines in Arkansas. Confederate forces used the railroad to transport troops to fight east of the Mississippi until Memphis fell to Union forces in June 1862. The eastern section was little used after that. Union troops under Gen. Frederick Steele occupied DeValls Bluff in August 1863 and utilized the western stretch of the Memphis to Little Rock Railroad after Steele's troops occupied Little Rock on September 10, 1863. The line was the frequent target of attack and sabotage by Confederate cavalrymen as it crossed the vast prairies east of the capital. This railroad, from Devall's Bluff to Little Rock, is through a prairie country, it is built in almost a Straight line, with but a few bridges, and those over inconsiderable streams. It can be very easily kept in running order. Amos F. Eno, Secretary pro tem of Arkansas, and Adjutant-General January 13, 1863 The railroad from Devall's Bluff to Little Rock is in working order, and I am now sending two engines around, to be used after taking Little Rock, and until the Arkansas rises that command can be supplied by White River and the railroad. Maj. Gen. Stephen Hurlbut September 9, 1863 The immediate and tangible fruits of my expedition are 577 prisoners, including 1 field officer and 11 line officers; over 200 Federals killed and wounded; ten miles of railroad track destroyed completely--the ties torn up and burned, the iron heated and bent, telegraph destroyed, bridges and trestle-works ruined; 3,000 bales of hay destroyed by fire; 20 hay machines chopped to pieces; 5 forts razed to the ground; 500 stand of small-arms distributed to my unarmed men; many fine horses captured; 12 barrels of salt brought off the field and given to a command suffering for it, besides supplying many needy soldiers with blankets, shoes, boots, hats, and clothing. All this was done within six miles of Devall's Bluff, and my detail was tearing up the track while the enemy's bullets, fired at the covering regiments, were throwing the splinters from the ties in their very faces.

DeValls Bluff: A Major Union Riverport,34.787221,-91.456209,History,"""Rising from the Boston Mountains, the White River meanders 720 miles to its junction with the Arkansas River in the southeastern part of the state. The fast-moving water kept the White River from suffering the build-up of silt that made such rivers as the Arkansas difficult to traverse for much of the year. The White River could accommodate deeper-draft vessels than most other rivers in the state. With its tall bluffs towering over the White River, DeValls Bluff was easily defendable and became the most important port on the river during the Civil War. Union gunboats could easily travel to the town, providing security for the steamboats carrying supplies that would then be transferred for railroad transport to Little Rock.
