Lakeport in the Civil War	33.25684	-91.15525	History	Side 1 When Arkansas went to war in 1861, Lycurgus and Lydia Johnson and their family stayed with their home at Lakeport. By 1862, U.S. gunboats were common on the Mississippi River, and on Sept. 6, 1862, Confederate troops burned 158 bales of cotton at Lakeport to prevent its seizure. Union raids targeted plantations such as Lakeport in 1863 and 1864, and the Johnsons claimed losses of 200 cattle, 8 mules and 2 horses, leaving'one mule...to haul wood for the children.' The family's slaves also sought freedom, and only 24 of 155 slaves remained here by 1864. (Continued on other side) Side 2 (Continued from other side) As the war wore on, Lycurgus Johnson joined many other delta plantation owners engaging in trade with Union forces, selling rope and bagging in exchange for cotton, cash and supplies. When the Civil War ended in 1865, the Johnsons still owned their home at Lakeport, but the value of their property had plummeted from $171,581 in 1860 to only $18,556 in 1865. Lycurgus Johnson adapted to the new conditions during Reconstruction and hired former slaves to work his fields. His fairness led the Freedmen's Bureau to call him a'model man of Chicot County.'

The Casualties at Ditch Bayou June 6, 1864	33.26954	-91.22214	History	The battle at Ditch Bayou was a Federal effort to drive Confederates away from the Mississippi River, where the Confederates had been harassing Union shipping. Even though the Confederates were outnumbered here, they were able to inflict heavy damage to their enemy. They had the advantage of six cannons, the protection of heavy timber and knowledge of the area. Muddy conditions caused the Northern infantry to attack across an open field without artillery support. After crossing the field under heavy fire, they discovered that they were trapped in the open field and were separated from the Confederates by Ditch Bayou. Union losses were 33 killed, 98 wounded, and one missing. Notice that their heaviest casualties were directly opposite the Confederate artillery. The Confederate losses included four killed and 33 wounded. Most of their casualties were in the artillery units where the Union troops concentrated their fire.

The Battle at Ditch Bayou	33.26954	-91.22215	History	It is the morning of June 6, 1864. Rain has created a muddy mess. To your left are four cannon. To your right are 600 cavalrymen and two more cannon. These men served under Confederate Colonel Colten Greene. To your front is Ditch Bayou, and 700 yards beyond that 3,000 troops under Union Major General A.J. Smith. Among them is the 8th Wisconsin with its mascot, Old Abe, the War Eagle. As the Union troops advance, the cannon thunder with grape and canister. The seasoned troops closed the gaps in their line and keep coming. They poured volley after volley toward their position. However, most of the Confederate troops are hidden in trees while the Union soldiers are caught in the open. The battle rages for six hours. The mile-long Federal line reaches the edge of the bayou. They have suffered high casualties, 132 killed, wounded, or missing. Federal losses would be higher had the black powder smoke not created a protective fog. Finally, ammunition dwindling, the Confederates make an orderly withdrawal and march past Lake Village. They have only four killed and 33 wounded. The Union troops bury their 33 dead on the battlefield and carry their wounded into town. Some of the seriously wounded men suffer for months until they die in a hospital. This was the largest battle to occur in Chicot County and the last significant battle on Arkansas soil.

Road to Marks Mills/Battle of Marks Mills	33.81660	-92.41204	History	Gen. Frederick Steele's Union army set out from Little Rock on March 23, 1864, to join a second army in Louisiana and invade Texas. He made it as far as modern-day Prescott before turning toward Camden in hopes of finding supplies for his starving army. Steele lost a supply train at Poison Spring on April 18, but a wagon train from Pine Bluff arrived on April 20 with 10 days' rations. He sent it back, along with 1,400 soldiers, to get more supplies. The column took roads near today's Fordyce on the way to Pine Bluff as Confederates approached.  Confederate Gen. James Fagan set an ambush east of here at Marks' Mills with 4,000 cavalrymen in two divisions. On April 25, 1864, they attacked the Union column from two sides, and a desperate, five-hour battle ended with the Union losing some 1,500 men killed, wounded and captured, along with hundreds of wagons. Fagan suffered only 293 casualties in what may have been the greatest Confederate triumph west of the Mississippi. The disaster at Marks' Mills led Steele to abandon Camden and retreat to Little Rock. He lost 2,750 men in the Camden Expedition.

Skirmish at Guesses Creek	34.14331	-92.60770	History	Gen. Frederick Steele's Union army left Camden on April 26, 1864, starting a retreat to Little Rock. Confederate pursuers caught up with them on April 29 on the Jenkins' Ferry Road and began skirmishing. Union gunners of the 2nd Missouri Artillery held them back as Confederate Col. W.L. Jeffers deployed his troops. Harris's Confederate Battery was sent to his support as soldiers of Burbridge's Missouri regiment came up. Union troops of the 40th Iowa, 43rd Illinois and 27th Wisconsin supported the Missouri battery as it held off the Confederates.  As the artillery duel continued, shells from the Confederate guns damaged a nearby home, known locally as the Cannonball House, before the Union men withdrew to the Saline River bottoms in a driving rain, knowing that Confederate troops were in pursuit and battle was likely as they tried to cross the flooded Saline River at Jenkins' Ferry the next day. The Cannonball House was one of several local buildings used as hospitals after the battle of Jenkins' Ferry and casualties from the battle are believed to have been buried in the yard near the house.
Bayou Bartholomew	34.17747	-92.00574	History	Beginning 10 miles northwest of Pine Bluff, this storied bayou flows 300 miles through 6 Arkansas counties and 2 Louisiana parishes before emptying into the Ouachita River in north Louisiana. Indian mounds dotted its banks. Immigrants travelled it by flatboat and settled in Jefferson County. While the origin of its name is uncertain, it was so known as early as 1786. Baron De Carondelet referred to it by name in a 1795 letter, and Don Carlos Trudeau, surveyor general of the Spanish Province of Louisiana, included it on a 1797 map. A man named Barthelemy is known to have been in the area as early as the 1680's.

Confederate Manufacturing / The Military Road	34.18072	-93.07053	History	(Side One) Confederate Manufacturing Arkadelphia was a manufacturing center for Confederate Arkansas early in the Civil War. Gen. Thomas Hindman established a powder works and an arsenal in 1862, producing guns, cannon, bullets, shells, wagons and caissons. Tanning yards provided harnesses, bridles, saddles, knapsacks and shoes. Tons of salt were produced at Arkadelphia, and a chemical laboratory there helped create such medicines as calomel, castor oil, spirits of nitre and tinctures of iron, with citizens providing the plants, weeds and herbs needed as raw materials to make the medicine. (Side Two) The Military Road The Military Road, following the route of the old Southwest Trail, passed through the heart of Clark County. Both Confederate and Union troops used the road. Gen. Sterling Price's Confederates retreated down the road after Little Rock fell in September 1863. Gen. Frederick Steele's Union army took the road during the Camden Expedition and stayed in Arkadelphia March 29 to April 1, 1864, before heading southwest. Confederate troops skirmished with Steele at Terre Noire Creek and Okolona before the Union army left the county at Elkins' Ferry on the Little Missouri.

Officers Killed/Union Wounded	34.18250	-92.58712	History	Gen. J.G. Walker's Texas Division made the final Confederate attack in the April 30, 1864, battle of Jenkins' Ferry. Its three brigades, led by Gen. William Read Scurry, Gen. Thomas N. Waul and Col. Horace Randal, charged the Union troops, who were protected by improvised fortifications, entering a field that allowed the U.S. soldiers to catch them in a cross fire. In the ensuing combat, both Scurry and Randal received mortal wounds, and Waul was also shot, though he stayed in the field until the battle ended and the Union army retreated.

Confederate Headquarters/Confederate Flank Attack	34.18331	-92.56933	History	Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith led troops from Louisiana on a forced march to attack Gen. Frederick Steele's Union army as it crossed the Saline River to retreat to Little Rock. He arrived here on April 29, 1864, and established his headquarters to plan his attack on Steele's army and wagon train the next day. As many as 20,000 men, many having just fought Union Gen. Nathaniel Banks's army at Mansfield, La., marched through here in pursuit of Steele. The battle of Jenkins' Ferry would be fought April 30 along Cox's Creek southwest of the Saline.
Fields of Battle/The Price of War	34.19130	-92.59259	History	As his army prepared to cross the swollen Saline River during its retreat to Little Rock, Union Gen. Frederick Steele met with his commanders in the cabin of widow Jane McWhorter Jenkins at 2 a.m. on April 30, 1864, to plan the approaching battle. The battle would begin on the Jenkins fields farmed by sons-in-law John M. and Robert H. Carver. Union engineers tore down the home of John and Lucinda Carver to build the pontoon bridge at Jenkins' Ferry that would carry Steele's army to safety as Gen. Samuel Rice's men held off Confederate troops.

Red River Campaign	34.21151	-92.54870	History	Tablet 1 Jenkins' Ferry State Park Act 10 of 1961 authorized this 37-acre state park as a commemorative site and recreation area. The park includes the ferry site where you are standing. The ferry was operated by the Jenkins' family prior to the Civil War and aided travelers on the Camden Road - a major travel route in pioneer Arkansas. In April of 1864, this site gained Civil War fame. Retreating from Camden to the safety of Little Rock, the Union Army was attacked by Confederate forces. General Frederick Steele used the ferry site as a bridgehead for spiriting his troops across the flooded Saline River and out of Confederate reach. Jenkins' Ferry, Marks' Mills and Poison Springs State Parks, and the 1836 Courthouse at Old Washington Historic State Park, which served as the Confederate Capitol of Arkansas at the time of the battle, are included in The Red River Campaign National Historic Landmark. Tablet 2 Red River Campaign (Battle of Jenkins' Ferry) Spring of 1864 saw war's violent hands seize southern Arkansas as Union leaders launched the Red River Campaign. Its purpose was to separate western Confederate forces from the east and to reopen access to Texas cotton. Union mistakes, heavy rain and floods, and strong Confederate resistance doomed the campaign to failure. On April 26, following such overwhelming defeats as Marks' Mills and Poison Springs, the Union VII Corps under General Frederick Steele pulled out of Camden heading north. General E. Kirby Smith's Confederate troops were less than 24 hours behind. The heavy Union wagons moved slowly as torrential rains turned the Camden Road into a quagmire. On April 29, Confederate infantry caught the Union army in the flooded white oak forest of the Saline River bottoms just south of Jenkins' Ferry. The battle raged for two days. Confederate forces mounted three major attacks but failed to halt the Union army's escape. Steele's troops managed to slip across the swollen Saline at Jenkins' Ferry on a mobile wooden bridge suspended by India Rubber pontoons. Once across, the bridge was sunk. Without a bridge, the Confederates could not follow. Bedraggled Union troops moved northward to higher ground where they burned many of their cumbersome wagons. The starving army then pressed on to Little Rock. The Campaign was over! The disastrous Red River Campaign was the Union's last major encroachment into south Arkansas. BATTLE STATISTICS Confederate 336 wounded 90 dead 1 missing Union 471 wounded 78 dead 40 missing Total 827 wounded 168 dead 41 missing Tablet 3 The Saline River Bottoms Found in the West Gulf Coastal Plain of southern Arkansas, Jenkins' Ferry Battlefield is on the banks of the free-flowing Saline River. The river's vast flood plain plays an integral part in the riverine ecology and in the history of the area. The damp, muddy canebrakes and wet marshes of this bottomland support abundant plant and animal life. Heavy rainfall and thick vegetation made travel difficult for settlers and nearly led to the destruction of Frederick Steele's Union Army in April of 1864. The heavy Union wagons bogged down in the flooded river bottoms south of the river. This gave the Confederates time to attack. Using an India rubber pontoon bridge, the Union Army was able to cross the river and escape.

Boone-Murphy House/Union Strategy and Pine Bluff	34.22592	-92.01015	History	Following the Union capture of Little Rock on Sept. 10, 1863, citizens of Pine Bluff asked that a Union garrison be stationed there for their protection. Gen. Frederick Steele sent the veteran 5th Kansas Cavalry and 1st Indiana Cavalry to establish a post. Union commander Col. Powell Clayton set up his headquarters and home in the Boone-Murphy House, which was then located at 702 W. Second Ave. Claytons troops, aided by former slaves from nearby refugee camps, fought off Confederate attackers Oct. 25, 1863, and retained control of Pine Bluff.

Refugee Children/Supplies Destroyed	34.23630	-92.53000	History	Many African Americans fleeing slavery were with Gen. Frederick Steele's Union army as it retreated to Little Rock. As army wagons became stuck in the thick mud, so too did wagons with refugee children. Some were abandoned by desperate parents; others were rescued by Union soldiers with on one shoulder a rifle, on the other a black child. At least one refugee child would stay with the Chapple McElroy family near here, who found an abandoned youth they named Tom. Tom McElroy lived with them into the 1870s, later owning a farm southwest of Benton.

Clash at Whittens Mill	34.31510	-92.55228	History	Both Union and Confederate cavalry moved north of Jenkins' Ferry on April 29, 1864. Lt. Col. Benjamin Elliott's 1st Missouri Cavalry Battalion had been sent to Princeton on the 28th to seek Gen. Frederick Steele's army as it retreated from Camden. They skirmished heavily with Union troops until dark, then proceeded toward Pratt's Ferry on the Saline River on April 29. Gen. E.A. Carr's Union cavalry, meanwhile, rode north to head off a potential attack on Steele's troops by Confederate Gen. James Fagan's Confederate cavalry, reported in the area. Elliott's Missouri cavalry arrived at Pratt's Ferry on April 29, 1864, hoping to link up with Fagan's Confederate cavalry. They were not there, so Elliott crossed the Saline River to find forage for his horses. On April 30, about 2,000 Union troops approached Whitten's Mill, some driving in Elliott's pickets. The Confederates counterattacked and the U.S. troops, fearing it was Fagan's entire force, quickly fell back and began burning their wagons and gear. Elliott's men continued to follow Steele's army as it retreated, attacking pickets and foragers.

Bridging the Ouachita River	34.38194	-92.82645	History	Gen. Frederick Steele led a Union army from Little Rock on March 23, 1864, to join an invasion of Texas. Confederate skirmishers harassed the army as it reached Rockport March 27. An inflatable pontoon bridge, in 34 wagons and served by men of the 24th Missouri and 4th Arkansas (African Descent) Infantry, was deployed to help the troops cross the Ouachita one-half mile from here. The Federals again used the bridge to cross the Little Missouri River at Elkins' Ferry 13 days later. Critically low on supplies, Steele turned to Camden, arriving April 15.  After occupying Camden, the Union army used the pontoon bridge to span the Ouachita and ease access to the U.S. troops at Pine Bluff and Little Rock. After suffering severe losses at Poison Spring and Marks' Mills, Steele abandoned Camden, taking the bridge up and rushing it forward to span the flooded Saline River at Jenkins' Ferry on April 30. After a savage battle, the Union army crossed. The much-used bridge was in poor condition and the starving mules too weak to pull the wagons, so the Federals destroyed it to prevent its use by Confederate forces.

Skirmish at Farrs Mill	34.51097	-93.05380	History	On July 5, 1864, a battalion of the 4th Arkansas Cavalry (U.S.) left Little Rock on a scouting mission toward Caddo Gap. They fought small bands of Confederate soldiers each day before arriving at Farr's Mill, where Gulpha Creek hits the Ouachita River. Union scouts were attacked in Hot Springs on present-day Central Avenue, then men of Cook's and Crawford's companies struck the 4th Arkansas at Farr's Mill. They were repulsed, losing 4 dead and 6 wounded while the 4th had 12 casualties in the expedition.

An American Spa	34.51160	-93.05370	History	Bathhouse Row is the historic heart of an American spa. Since the 1830s the city of Hot Springs has channeled much of its energy into becoming a national health resort. The Federal Government made taking the waters available to all by providing baths and health services to veterans and the poor, and the National Park landscaped many of the exercise paths that were considered essential to good health. Some of the bathhouses have closedlocally, demand for the medicinal baths peaked in 1946but you can still discover the spa experience. Traditional bathing remains available at the Buckstaff Bathhouse and some nearby hotels. Like earlier visitors, you can stroll the beautiful brick Grand Promenade behind Bathhouse Row or hike mountain trails throughout the National Park.

Buck Ewing	34.51173	-93.05300	History	Many baseball historians regard Ewing as the greatest all-around 19th century player. He came to the Army-Navy Hospital in Hot Springs in 1892, seeking medical advice for his sore throwing arm. On March 19th, after successful treatment, he hit a home run at the Hot Springs Baseball Grounds in an exhibition game against Cap Anson's Colts (the Chicago Cubs).

Bathhouse Row	34.51180	-93.05390	History	The buildings along Bathhouse Row are the latest stage in a succession of bathhouses. In the 1830s Hot Springs' earliest facilities were makeshift shelters perched over individual springs. Later, elaborate Victorian bathhouses flourished along the avenue, but the wooden structures were susceptible to rot and devastating fires. The present mix of Spanish mission and neoclassical architecture dates from 1911 to 1939, the Golden Age of Bathing. The Buckstaff remains open for traditional bathing, while the National Park Service preserves Bathhouse Row as a significant national cultural landmark. Captions: Hale Bathhouse on Hot Springs Creek, 1867. Assembly room in Fordyce Bathhouse. In the middle of Bathhouse Row, at the Fordyce Bathhouse Visitor Center, you can explore restored interiors furnished with tubs, steam cabinets, and hydrotherapy equipment from 1915-1920.

Buckstaff Bathhouse	34.51210	-93.05380	History	From its opening the handsome Buckstaff Bathhouse aggressively promoted its image. To gain customers the owners mounted a huge sign on the roof to attract people from the large hotels a block away. Other bathhouses lost character as they modernized, but the Buckstaff kept its historic appearance and emphasized its reputation for service. Although many of its competitors closed between 1962 and 1985, the Buckstaff continues to operate as a bathhouse. On Bathhouse Row it is the sole operating survivor from the Golden Age of Bathing. Captions: Men's bathhall around 1920. Buckstaff Bathhouse, 1920.

Lamar Bathhouse	34.51230	-93.05370	History	The present masonry Lamar Bathhouse, completed in 1923, has a symmetrical, California style of architecture. The large lobby contains nostalgic murals of historic landscapes, and country scenes. Art Deco stairs, signs, and lights decorated the building. Advertising a tub for every-sized person, the Lamar Bathhouse also featured a large sun porch to promote natural health. Like many Victorian bathhouses, the wooden 1890s Lamar Bathhouse had stickwork decorations and railed roof walkways. An investigator wrote of the buildings' vulnerability: All agree that the vapor from the hot water rots all timber with which it comes in contact in remarkably short time No more wooden buildings should be allowed.

Ozark Bathhouse	34.51270	-93.05380	History	The mission style of the Ozark Bathhouse may relate to the claim that Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto visited the hot springs. The building's twin towers are strictly decorative. On Bathhouse Row, the Quapaw, the Fordyce, and Hale Bathhouses, with their red clay roof tiles, also reflect this Spanish association. The Ozark's scroll and shield decorations and classical designs on window planters suggest a relationship with Roman baths. Caption: The Ozark as it appeared in 1915 (above) and in 1882 (right).

Quapaw Bathhouse	34.51320	-93.05370	History	The Caddo, Quapaw, and Choctaw tribes lived in or visited the area during the 1700s and 1800s. This edifice pays homage to their lasting influence. The owners named the bathhouse for the Quapaw Indians, and incorporated an Indian head design over the entrance. The towering building dominates Bathhouse Row. Captions: Dome tile. The Quapaw's ceramic tile dome was inspired by the bathhouse domes in North Africa and southern France. The Quapaw Bathhouse was completed in 1922.

Hot Springs: The Birthplace of Spring Baseball	34.51519	-93.07294	History	Left Side Hot Spring's reputation as a health and recreation resort attracting the rich and famous was certainly true in the late 1800's and well into the 20th century. The city had fine hotels, lively nightclubs, a beautiful mountain setting, and the famous hot water from the natural springs. In 1886, Cap Anson brought his Chicago White Stockings (now the Cubs) to Hot Springs. This bustling turn-of-the-century spa resort with its famous hot baths, mountains, trails, hotels, and activities was the perfect place for something no one had ever heard of: spring training for professional baseball. Soon, teams had built five fields and as many as 250 players, including the legends of the game, trained here year after year. Now you can follow The Hot Springs Baseball Trail and stand where legends stood and records were set. Read and hear stories of the players and places that shaped baseball. Pick up a guide map at the Hot Springs Visitor Center in Hill Wheatley Plaza on Central Avenue, at the Alligator Farm, or at Oaklawn Racetrack. Each Baseball Trail marker has a digital'code' that can link to your smartphone to historic photos, audio and more. With a phone call you can hear stories of the golden age of baseball in Hot Springs.

Battery D	34.51942	-90.59550	History	Hindman Hill, southernmost of four positions fortified by Union Forces in June, 1863, was attacked by the 35th, 37th, and Hawthorns Arkansas Infantry Regiments under General Fagan, CSA at daybreak, July 4, 1863. Thwarted by the strength of the Union defenses, manned by the 43rd Indiana, the 33rd and 35th Missouri, and the 33rd Iowa, Fagans brigade retreated at 11 A.M. along the Upper Little Rock Road. About 250 men of the 37th Arkansas were captured after failing to receive the signal to withdraw. Total casualties for Fagans brigade were 47 killed, 115 wounded, and 273 missing.
General J.F. Fagans Attack	34.51942	-90.59559	History	Hawthorns Regiment advanced from the south, that of Bell from the north, King massed on Hawthorns right. They charged at daybreak, clambering over fallen timber, and took the first line of rifle pits. Battery C not yet engaged by Price, caught Fagans Brigade in a deadly enfilading fire. Nevertheless they took three more lines at point of bayonet. By 7 A.M. the command arrived in front of Battery D. McRae came to Fagans aid but was repulsed. Fagan carried the last line of rifle pits and made a desperate effort to capture the battery. Cut down by Union reinforcements, they held their position until ordered to retreat.

the gun boat Tyler saved the day	34.52061	-90.58034	History	The guns of the U.S.S Tyler sent their last blast hurtling toward Graveyard Hill at 10:30 A.M. on July 4, 1863. The Confederates were retreating. Helena remained in Union hands. The Battle of Helena, July 4 1863 The Tyler steamed into action before dawn, firing on Confederate troops near Helena on the Little Rock Road. Two hours later the Tyler's captain, Lieutenant Commander James M. Pritchett, brought the gunboat opposite Battery C. A Barrage of Shot and Shell As the Confederates aimed the captured battery's guns on Fort Curtis, the Tyler opened fire. Her broadside guns poured fire onto Graveyard Hill and into the ravines sheltering sharpshooters. Her stern guns pounded the battery below as her bow guns poured shells into the upper battery. The Tyler's gunners fired 433 rounds of shots and shell with deadly effect. The Tyler's Captain Praised General Benjamin Prentiss, Commander of the Union forces at Helena, wrote Admiral David D. Porter,'Pritchett acquitted himself with honor and distinction...I attribute not a little of our success in the late battle to his full knowledge of the situation.' The U.S.S Tyler Goes to War The U.S. Navy converted the U.S.S. Tyler from a freight passenger steamer to a timberclad gunboat in August 1861. The Boat The Tyler was a paddle wheeler with a wheel at each side. She was 180 feet long and 52 feet wide. The Reinforced Hull Five inches of oak on the upper deck and pilot areas protected the Tyler from small arms fire but nothing heavier. Barges tied alongside helped protected the hull. The Guns The Tyler carried three 30-pounders, one 12-pounder and six 8-inch smooth bore guns. Photographs: USS Tyler on one of the Western rivers, circa 1862-1865.

Hell-in-Arkansas	34.52227	-90.57972	History	The nickname the 33rd Iowa Infantry gave Helena was hardly flattering. It came not from a hard fought battle but from miserable conditions in an overcrowded city made worse by the climate. Soldiers Battled Malaria, Typhoid and More Many Union regiments camped in a low area between Helena and the Mississippi River. No one knew that mosquitoes carried malaria and yellow fever. Leander Stillwell contracted malaria soon after he arrived in Helena.'I just lay there, in a hot tent, on the sand, - oh, so sick! But I fought off going to the hospital as long as possible... I had seen so many boys loaded into ambulances, and hauled off to such place, who never returned...' Medical Science was Primitive Most Civil War-era doctors believed that vapors-bad air-caused illness. Doctors did not know that drinking contaminated water led to typhoid, diarrhea and other illnesses. They ordered soldiers to drink water from the river instead of the free-flowing springs. Extreme heat, periodic flooding and overcrowding added to the men's misery. Thousands of soldiers died during the Union occupation of Helena. Most of those deaths could be prevented today.'I remained at the hospital eight days... and retain a distinct recollection of only a few things. But aside from men dying all around me, both day and night, nothing important happened.' Leander Stillwell A Union army camp's graveyard, drawn during the Civil War by Edwin Forbes. Each soldier's grave is marked with a wooden headboard. After the Civil War, the Federal government removed the remains of Union soldiers buried in and around Helena and reinterred them in the National Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.'There are about 30 thousand troops encamped in and around Helena, and I can say without exaggerating that there is buried forty men every day and sometimes more.' Charles O. Musser, 29th Iowa.'Yes, truly, Helena is a city in a swamp... which the valorous Sixth help hold through trying times, in the face of poisonous dangers a hundred fold more damaging and terrifying than the fiercest battlefield.' W.P. Belden, Surgeon, 6th Minnesota Background: The Camp of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry in Helena. Like many regimental camps, it was located between the levee and the Mississippi River because the flat land could accommodate hundreds of tents. Photo Courtesy Iowa State Historical Society.
They Passed This Way	34.52236	-90.58539	History	I have no more land, I am driven away from home, driven up the red waters, let us all go, let us all die together and somewhere upon the banks we will be there.' - Sin-e-cha's Song, heard on several removal boats along the Trail of Tears. After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the United States government forced tens of thousands of American Indians to leave their ancestral lands in the southeast for new homes in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They traveled over established land and water routes all of which led through Arkansas. Rather than risk disease and other hazards of summer travel, many groups left in the fall and faced, instead, treacherous winter weather. Thousands died during the ordeal - remembered today as the Trail of Tears. Despite the hardships of the journey, the people of the five tribes of the Southeast established new lives in the West. They stand now as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions, while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. Lower level of marker: Federal Indian Removal In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly removed approximately 16,000 Cherokee, 21,000 Muscogee (Creek), 9,000 Choctaw, 6,000 Chickasaw, and 4,000 Seminole from the southeastern United States. Federal Indian removal policy aroused fierce and bitter debate. Supporters of the policy claimed it was a benevolent action to save the tribes east of the Mississippi River from being overwhelmed and lost in the onslaught of an expanding American population. Opponents decried its inhumanity and the tragic consequences it would have for the Indian peoples. One thing was certain removal freed millions of acres of Indian lands for use by American settlers. In 1987, to commemorate this tragic chapter in American history, the United States Congress designated the primary land and water routes of the Cherokee removal as the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Today, the National Park Service partners with the southeastern tribes the Trail of Tears Association and other non-government organizations federal, state, and local agencies and private landowners to foster the appreciation and preservation of historic sites and segments and to tell the story of forced removal of the Cherokee people and other American Indian tribes. You can visit certified sites, segments, and interpretive facilities along the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail by following the Auto Tour route. Look for the official logo along the way.

Helena and The Trail of Tears	34.52236	-90.58539	History	The steamer Warren brought news... of the loss of the steamboat Monmouth, and the death of at least one-half of her infamously crowded passengers. This fatal, and most appalling, accident arose from a collision between these two boats but from the best intelligence we can procure the blame rests upon the Monmouth, ... Six hundred {Creek} were jammed into this boat... and three hundred have perished.' - Arkansas Gazette, November 28, 1837. The Water Route to the Indian Territory Here, Helena residents of the 1830s watched tens of thousands of Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Chickasaw pass by as they traveled the Mississippi River. Passengers on steamboats, flatboats, and keelboats, they were on their way to the Arkansas River, and ultimately, to Indian Territory- what is now Oklahoma. Thousands would die, victims of the hardships of the forced relocation from the southeastern United States. Helena, founded in 1820, was a bustling port by the time the removal detachments passed by while traveling west on the Mississippi River to Indian Territory.

The Battle of Helena	34.52244	-90.58540	History	From where you are standing, you would have had a ringside seat for the battle of Helena. On a brutally hot July 4, 1863, Confederate General Theophilus Holmes launched a three-pronged attack on the small Union garrison at Helena. Union defenses centered around Battery A north of here, Battery B northwest of here, Battery C due west of where you are standing, and Battery D southwest of here. Fort Curtis, an earthen fortification was within Helen's city limits northwest of here and the U.S. gunboat Tyler on the Mississippi River behind you provided crucial support in defeating the Confederate assault. More than 7,600 Confederate soldiers, mainly from Arkansas and Missouri, attacked the 4,000 Union defenders of Helena. Only the attack against Battery C succeeded, but it was broken by Union counterattacks and the terrible shells of the Tyler. The Confederate attackers lost 1,636 men killed, wounded and missing or captured. Union forces lost only 239 men.'The ground at this point was impassible - an old road and a deep ravine full of timber, which scattered our men and it was impossible to keep in line but we succeeded in getting through after remaining in the timber and hollows nearly two hours under a heavy fire, and made a charge when, the enemy giving way, we entered the rifle pits. Here many of our men fell, perfectly exhausted from overheat.' Dennis Bahen 37th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, C.S.A'The rest of the batteries got range of them, and the gunboats began to shell them. Oh, what slaughter and bloodshed. They were mowed down by hundreds by grape Shot and Shell. It makes the cold chills run over me as I think of the dreadful Scene I witnessed on the battlefield, men lying in heaps in some of the ravines, four and five deep.' Charles O. Musser, 29th Iowa Infantry Regiment, U.S.A

KFFA 1360 Helena	34.52261	-90.58616	History	The music of the Arkansas Delta is the music of America. With roots in gospel or'church music,' the blues, jazz, country, and rock n'roll flowed from the rich, fertile landscape bordering the lower Mississippi River and spread out across the country and the world. Follow the Arkansas Delta Music Trail to experience the sounds that shaped the land, its people, and the nation. KFFA 1360 Helena King Biscuit Time'King Biscuit Time' first aired live on November 21, 1941, on Helena, Arkansas's KFFA 1360 AM radio. Since that time, the program has become the longest-running daily blues radio show in the United States, as well as an influential platform for up-and-coming blues performers. The award-winning program has aired more times that the'Grand Ole Opry' and has outlasted'American Bandstand' by at least a generation. Legendary bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson was the original host of King Biscuit Time, playing live with Robert Perkins and James Peck Curtis-in the KFFA studio. The show was named after King Biscuit Flour, distributed throughout the Arkansas Delta by Interstate Grocer Company. The company agreed to sponsor a radio production for Sonny Boy and his band in exchange for live commercials for King Biscuit Flour. King Biscuit Time was the first regular radio show to feature blues and has influenced generations of delta blues and rock n' roll artists whose sounds are based on the raw energy of Sonny Boy Williamson's music. The daily programming of Sonny Boy Williamson, Pinetop Perkins, Robert Jr. Lockwood, and other Delta blues legends laid the foundation for the blues, rock, pop, and hip-hop music of today. Award-winning'Sunshine' Sonny Payne has hosted the show since 1951 and has been a presence on King Biscuit Time since its inception in 1941. A recognized blues musician in his own right, Payne welcomes visitors to the live broadcast each week at noon. In keeping with its tradition of broadcasting live music from the studio, King Biscuit Time still welcomes artists in the studio almost weekly, and the show's record-setting 15,000 plus broadcasts document the formation of a true American art form. Under Sunshine Sonny's direction, King Biscuit Time was awarded the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award in 1992, which recognizes outstanding achievement in the field of radio and broadcast journalism. The Delta Cultural Center became'home' to King Biscuit Time in the early 1990's, and the show is broadcast live daily from a special studio in downtown Helena and streamed around the world via KFFA's website, www.kffa.com Arkansas Delta Music Trail Paid for with a combination of state funds and regional tourism promotion association funds www.deltabyways.com
The Blues Trail: Mississippi to Helena	34.52283	-90.58617	History	Helena has played a vital role in blues history for artists from both sides of the Mississippi River. Once known as a wide open hot spot for music, gambling, and nightlife, Helena was also the birthplace of King Biscuit Time, the groundbreaking KFFA radio show that began broadcasting blues to the Arkansas-Mississippi Delta in 1941. The program had logged over 15,000 broadcasts by 2009 and inspired Helena to launch its renowned King Biscuit Blues Festival in 1986. (Side 2): The town emerged as a major center of culture and commerce in the Delta during the steamboat era and maintained its freewheeling river port atmosphere well into the mid-20th century. Cafes, night spots, and good-time houses flourished, and musicians flocked here to entertain local fieldhands, sawmill workers, and roustabouts who came off the boats ready for action. Many bluesmen ferried across the river from Mississippi or later motored across the Helena Bridge. Others came from elsewhere in Arkansas, up from Louisiana, or down from Memphis. Helena was at one time home to Mississippi-born blues legends Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson No. 2 (Rice Miller), James Cotton, Honeyboy Edwards, and Pinetop Perkins, as well as to Arkansas natives Roosevelt Sykes, Robert Nighthawk, Robert Lockwood Jr., Frank Frost, Jimmy McCracklin, and George Harmonica Smith, all of whom became influential figures in the blues. Williamson, Nighthawk, and Lockwood were among the first bluesmen to play their instruments through amplifiers, paving the transitional path of blues from acoustic to electric musica development often attributed to Muddy Waters in Chicago in the late 1940s. Soon after KFFA went on the air on November 19, 1941, Williamson's broadcasts on King Biscuit Time brought blues to an audience that had seldom if ever heard such music on the radio. Up-and-coming bluesmen B.B. King, Albert King, Jimmy Reed, and Muddy Waters all tuned in to the lunchtime broadcasts from the KFFA studios, or on occasion from WROX in Clarksdale, advertising King Biscuit Flour and promoting their upcoming shows at local juke joints and house parties. The sponsor, Interstate Grocer Company, even introduced a Sonny Boy brand of corn meal. During Williamson's extended stays away from Helena, drummer James Peck Curtis kept the program going with an assortment of band members. The show eventually switched to records instead of live music and continued with deejay Sonny Payne at the helm. Off the air only from 1980 until 1986, it still ranks as one of the longest-running programs in radio history. The Delta Cultural Center began hosting the broadcast in the 1990s. The Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival, a favorite event among blues enthusiasts around the country, began as the King Biscuit Blues Festival in 1986, welcoming back former King Biscuit Entertainers Robert Lockwood and Pinetop Perkins for the first of many annual appearances, along with a variety of other acts including perennial local favorites Frank Frost, Lonnie Shields, Sam Carr, and CeDell Davis.

Seven Confederate Generals	34.52813	-90.58717	History	Seven Phillips Co. men served as generals in the Confederate army. Patrick Cleburne, perhaps the most acclaimed Arkansas general, led an Army of Tennessee division and proposed freeing slaves if they would fight for the Confederacy. He was killed in the battle of Franklin, Tenn. Thomas C. Hindman built an Arkansas army from scratch and led it at Prairie Grove; he also commanded a division east of the Mississippi. He was murdered in Helena after the war. Lucius E. Polk led Cleburnes brigade after that generals promotion until wounds forced him to retire.  Daniel C. Govan led a brigade in Tennesssee and Georgia before surrendering in North Carolina in 1865. James C. Tappan led his Arkansans in battles in Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, and at Jenkins Ferry, Ark. Cleburne, Hindman and Tappan are buried in Helenas Maple Hill Cemetery. Two of the seven were acting generals. Charles W. Adams led two infantry regiments before serving on Thomas C. Hindmans staff and in administrative positions in Arkansas. Archibald Dobbins led a brigade of cavalry, though he never received a brigadiers star.

Civil War Comes to Arkansas	34.52822	-90.58718	History	In the first months of 1861 many Phillips County men joined militia companies supporting the Confederate cause. In February 1861, they marched on Little Rock to take the Federal arsenal. Most joined the Confederate army that spring. A Divided Nation on the Brink of War By 1860, many believed that war could not be avoided. Abraham Lincoln won the presidential election in November 1860. Weeks later, South Carolina left the Union. Others followed. The nation unraveled. In the troubled months before and after the presidential election, the men of Phillips County formed seven militia companies, including the Yell Rifles and Phillips Guards. As war drew closer they prepared to defend,'our equality in the Union, our social system, our property, and our liberties. ' 'The Union of States may no longer be regarded as an existing fact.' Arkansas Governor Henry Rector, December 1860. Crisis in Little Rock In early February, rumors began to spread- the Federal government planned to reinforce the Little Rock arsenal. Secessionists in Helena urged the governor to take action. The Yell Rifles, Phillips Guards and other Delta militia marched to Little Rock, ready to take the arsenal by force. Hoping to avoid bloodshed, Governor Rector met with the arsenal commander, Captain James Totten. The badly outnumbered commander agreed to leave. Satisfied, the militia returned to the Delta. Leaving Helena After their return, Miss Emma Rightor, representing the young ladies of Helena, presented a flag to Capt. Joseph C. Barlow of the Phillips Guards. In late April 1861, the Phillip Guards and Yell Rifles left Helena to join the Confederate army. Arkansas did not leave the Union until May, but their Civil War had begun. Many never saw Phillips County again, dying in service to the Confederacy before the Civil War finally ended in May 1865. Captions: This drawing of the Little Rock Arsenal appeared in the March 9, 1861, issue of Harper's magazine. Right, the arsenal today, now the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History. Above, the flag presented to the Phillips Guards by the young ladies of Helena. Captain Joseph C. Barlow, left, survived the war. He returned to Helena and later became active in the United Confederate Veterans. (Side 2): In Confederate Service Joining the Confederate Army In the weeks following the beginning of the Civil War, one-third of the men in Phillips County fit for military service joined the Confederate army. Several hundred men enlisted between 1861 and 1865. Men from Helena and Phillips County formed all or parts of the 2nd Arkansas, 13th Arkansas, 15th Arkansas, and 23rd Arkansas Infantry regiments, the Helena Light Artillery (Key's Battery) and Dobbins' 1st Arkansas Cavalry. Most of these regiments fought with the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater of the war. Dobbins's Arkansas Cavalry operated in the Trans-Mississippi and fought in the Battle of Helena. Captions The flag of the 1st Arkansas Infantry. Lieutenant Robert Caswell Moore was one of 96 Helena men who enlisted in the 13th Arkansas Infantry. The Union army seized his home in 1862. The Moore-Hornor House is located at 323 Beech Street. Captain Edward H. Cowley of Phillips County served with the 15th Arkansas Infantry. He was captured at Shiloh. Civilians in Phillips County supported the Southern war effort by purchasing war bonds. Benefits raised money and morale. Many families had sons, brothers or husbands serving in the Confederate Army. (Side 3): The End of Everything They Knew It is impossible for us to fully understand the changes the Civil War brought to Phillips County. Soldiers returning home in the spring of 1865 found that their lives, societyeverything they had known in 1861was no more. Some men could not face the changes and left the country. Archibald Dobbins, a wealthy planter before the war, found his way to Brazil. General Thomas Hindman fled to Mexico, though he returned to Helena in 1868. Bittersweet Homecoming Thousands of men died in the war. Almost everyone in Phillips County mourned someone. General Patrick Cleburne's law partner, Priestly H. Mangum, returned to Helena with only $30 to his name and resumed the practice of law. Patrick Cleburne died at the Battle of Franklin. Robert Caswell Moore was one of the few Helena men in the 13th Arkansas Regiment who returned. James Lanier fought in the Battle of Helena. He returned to Phillips County and resumed farming. His brother, Albert, did not. His family said that his last days were spent in a Federal prison. Rebuilding Lives Joseph C. Barlow worked in the dry goods trade before leaving Helena with the Phillips Guards in 1861. After the war he returned to Helena and opened a hardware store. Jesse P. Clopton and Roland J. Cook survived the war and returned to their farms. Cadwallader Polk, brother of General Lucius Polk, returned to the family homestead and resumed farming but Lucius, his health broken, never returned to Arkansas.

The Right to Vote	34.52830	-90.58681	History	The State of Arkansas is Dissolved In 1867, the state of Arkansas ceased to exist. It was dissolved, as were all states still in rebellion when the Confederate government surrendered in 1865. Readmission to the Union required that the states meet two conditions set by the U.S. Congress. Congress demanded that the former states write new constitutions that included universal manhood suffrage, ensuring that former slaves had the right to vote. They were also required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which among other things guaranteed all male citizens 21 years and older the right to vote. The 1868 Constitutional Convention Arkansas held a constitutional convention in 1868 to write a new constitution that satisfied the requirements set by Congress. Most former Confederates no longer had the right to vote. However, male Freedmen over twenty-one years of age did. For the first time, African American men helped write laws in Arkansas. Two of those men were William H. Grey and James T. White, Baptist ministers from Phillips County. William Grey and James White James White and William Grey served as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Little is known about White, but Grey, who had never been a slave, took a very active role. He had worked for former Virginia Governor Henry Wise and understood how government worked. Grey was an outspoken advocate for the rights of Freedmen.'We are here not to ask for charity at the hands of this honorable body, but to receive at the hands of the people of Arkansas, in Convention assembled, the apportionment of our rights,' he declared. The New Constitution A new constitution changed Arkansas. It gave African Americans the right to vote, to serve on juries, serve in the militia, and to hold office. It established free public schools for all and provided for a state university. The 1868 Constitution helped make Arkansas the state it is today.

Helena, Arkansas	34.52880	-90.58630	History	Helena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the river', wrote Mark Twain in Life on the Mississippi, and is rich in history and culture. Hernando DeSoto crossed the Mississippi near Helena in 1541, finding a thriving native culture. When Sylvanus Phillips settled in the area in 1797, all indications of the flourishing native American civilization were gone. Helena, Phillips' daughter, was her namesake for this historic river town. Helena, which lies at the southern tip of Crowley's Ridge, is one of the oldest towns in Arkansas. It was an important river town during the Civil War, and the deadly'Battle of Hell' was fought on July 4, 1863, when the Confederate forces attempted to take the town from Federal occupation. Their efforts failed miserably. Helena, home to three separate historic districts, also lies at the intersection of two national scenic byways and is home to over 30 structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Helena also home to one of the largest free Blues festivals in the world, The King Biscuit Blues Festival.

Phillips County, Arkansas	34.52888	-90.58638	History	Phillips County lies in what is known as the Mississippi alluvial plain, also called The Delta. The earliest known inhabitants were native Indians, noted for building large earthen mounds for ceremonial purposes and to bury their chiefs. By the time Hernando DeSoto explored Arkansas in 1541 the area was home to two sophisticated Indian cultures, the Casoui and the Pacaha, and included large fortified towns. The point where DeSoto crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas is much debated, with credible evidence that he crossed south of Helena into what is now Phillips County, opposite Sunflower Landing. Between 1541 and 1803, France sold the territory known as the Louisiana Purchase, composed of 900,000 square miles to the United States for 15 million dollars. Phillips County was created by an act of the Arkansas legislature dated May 1, 1820 and named for one of its earliest settlers, Sylvanus Phillips, a member of the Territorial Legislature.

West Helena, Arkansas	34.52889	-90.58644	History	The City of West Helena was a vision in the early nineteen hundreds of Edward Chaffin Hornor and John Sidney Hornor, cousins. Their plans for the creation of West Helena on the western slope of Crowley's ridge was accomplished with the filing on June 20, 1910 of a deed of dedication and plat. Their foresight in planning the city provided for residential, commercial and industrial areas. The lot sizes and street widths meet the standards of today's planners. Water and sewer facilities were built and an electric rail street car system was constructed to provide transportation service between Helena and West Helena.

We are all the same as dead men	34.52928	-90.58802	History	Conditions in Civil War Helena were horrible. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water, and mosquitoes led to typhoid, dysentery, malaria and other diseases. Tents, churches, barns, abandoned houses and business buildings housed thousands of sick soldiers. Sick Men, Grim Hospitals Annie Wittenmeyer visited Helena in August 1863. She came with the Western Sanitary commission, an organization much like today's Red Cross. Her report on the military hospitals were grim.'We found the hospitals at Helena, if they may be called hospitals, in a dreadful condition. The Methodist and Baptist Churches were crowded with very sick and severely wounded men. There were very few cots in these two churches. Most of the men were lying in the narrow pews, with the scant uneven cushions for their beds. The weather was extremely hot, and flies swarmed over everybody and everything.' Feeling of Hopelessness Sanitary Commission aids visited a convalescent camp located on the sandy banks of the Mississippi River. The August sun beat down, turning the tents into furnaces. Behind the tents was a wide cypress swamp,'stagnant and green and deadly.' Aid workers brought healthy food, clean clothing and blankets to the camp but the discouraged men told them their efforts were useless.'it is only question of time,' one said,'your efforts will only prolong our suffering we are all the same as dead men. ' 'The faces of some of the men, who were too helpless to keep up a continual fight with them, were black with swarms of hungry buzzing flies.' Annie Wittenmeyer, August 1863

William Patterson	34.52950	-90.59183	History	William Patterson was the first known Methodist to set foot on Arkansas soil. He came from Kentucky in 1800 and cut the cane, where the city of Helena now stands, to build a warehouse for river traffic. He became a Methodist Minister and in 1804 was admitted to the Western Conference with assignment to the Scioto Circuit in Ohio. Although there is no positive evidence, it is probable that he preached at Helena. He was the father of John Patterson, the first white child of American Parents in Arkansas.

Service with Distinction	34.54290	-90.59092	History	Seven men from Phillips County, all of them immigrants to Arkansas, became high ranking Confederate officers. They served with honor in the Army of the Tennessee and in the Trans-Mississippi, participating in many decisive battles and campaigns. The Arkansas Frontier, 1835-1861 Many ambitious men came to Phillip County before the Civil War, drawn by the opportunities offered by the frontier. Among them were lawyers Charles Adams and James Tappan Patrick Cleburne, an Irish immigrant Archibald Dobbins, a farmer and Daniel Govan, Thomas Hindman and Lucius Polk - men of means. All enlisted in the Confederate army soon after the war began. Serving the Confederacy,1861-1965 James Tappan saw combat first, leading the 13th Arkansas at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861. Hindman, Cleburne, Govan, Tappan and Polk fought at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Tappan and Hindman returned to Arkansas but the other fought with the Army of Tennessee at Richmond, Perryville, Stones River, Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge. Hindman rejoined them at Chickamauga and they fought together until he was wounded at Kennesaw Mountain. The rest served together until Cleburne's death at Franklin, Tennessee, in November 1864. Hindman became commander of the military district of the Trans-Mississippi. Adams and Dobbins fought with him at Prairie Grove in December 1862. Adams later commanded the Northern Sub-District of Arkansas. Dobbins led his cavalry regiment at the Battle of Helena on July 4, 1863, and commanded a brigade at the Battle of Big Creek in Phillips County in 1864. Tappan fought in the Red River Campaign at Jenkin's Ferry. Returning from the War After the war Thomas Hindman went to Mexico. He was assassinated soon after returning to Helena.

Quapaws, Choctaws, and Chickasaws Passed Here	34.56380	-92.58700	History	The Indian parties followed an ancient trail that became known as the Southwest Trail. The primitive trail took the tribal groups by where you are standing. William S. Lockhart was the first permanent settler in the area, arriving in 1815, at a place where the trail crossed the Saline River. In 1831, Lockhart was named postmaster of the new Saline Crossing post office and was granted exclusive rights to build a toll bridge. Other settlers began to move into the area but preferred higher ground and established Benton in 1833. Quapaws About December 19, 1825, the Quapaw Tribe numbering 455 passed where you are standing along to new homes. In 1824 the Quapaws had signed a treaty giving away the remainder of their tribal land in Arkansas Territory for land among the Caddo Tribe on the Red River in Northern Louisiana. Government agent Antoine Barraque and Chief Heckaton led the emigration. Conditions proved disastrous for the Quapaws in their new home and they again passed here returning to an area near their old homes between June 1827 and 1830. Choctaws Removal of the Choctaws through here began about January 1, 1832 with the passing of a party of 594 Choctaws accompanied by a government agent and Choctaw leader David Folsom. Following behind were two groups from Chief Nitakitchi's district. The first group of 1,305 accompanied by Nitakitchi's Captain Iyacherhopia passed here February 1, 1832. The other 213 of the party accompanied by Chief Nitakitchi come along 3 days later. Between November 23, 1832, and November 21, 1833, six additional government escorted parties passed here with a total of 3,870 Choctaws. Chickasaws On July 25, 1837 agent John M. Millard camped with a party of 516 Chickasaws on the north shore of the Arkansas River opposite Little Rock. The plan was for most of the Chickasaws to go on a steamboat and the rest to go on the road on the north side of the river to Indian Territory. About 300 Chickasaws led by Chief Samuel Sealy refused to go any way other than to cross the Arkansas and start south down the trail. Millard went with the steamboat party and then returned to Little Rock. On August 10, 1837, Millard started down the Southwest Trail in search of Sealy's party. He found some had only traveled five miles. As Millard traveled along he collected more and more of the Chickasaws. By August 12, 1837 he was getting close to this site. He wrote in his journal, This day was taken up in bringing the sick and scattered Indians to the principal party and procuring wagons to send to Little Rock for provisions. Sealy's group reached Indian Territory September 3, 1837. Between 1838 and 1842, at least three other parties of Chickasaws passed here on their way to Indian Territory. One of these groups was led by Chickasaw Ishehotopa. (Left Image Caption) Lt. I.P. Simonton wrote in his journal on December 3, 1832, Crossed the Saline River about 12 o'clock. In consequence of a sudden rise of the river obliged to ferry the sick, women and children. The above receipt is a copy from the National Archives of that transaction with Lockhart. (Quotation on Right Image) We are exceedingly tired. We have just heard of the ratification of the Choctaw Treaty, our doom is sealed. There is no other course for us but to turn our faces to our new homes, towards the setting sun. David Folsom, 1831 (Right Image Caption) David Folsom was an important leader of the Choctaw Nation. He led a party to Indian Territory in 1831, helped his people get settled and plant spring crops, and returned to Mississippi to lead another party west the next year.

Fort Steele	34.73444	-92.28027	History	After occupying Little Rock Sept. 10, 1863, Union officials made plans to fortify the capital city. Construction began Nov. 9 on a square redoubt which will command the city and all principal approaches. The resulting earthwork was named Fort Steele and it became the central point in a network of batteries and rifle pits built to defend Little Rock from Confederate attack. The fort, bristling with cannon and manned by veteran Union infantrymen, apparently did its job well, as Confederate forces never mounted an offensive to retake Little Rock.

Tuf-Nut Lofts	34.74545	-92.26606	History	This property operated as horse stable in the late 19th century followed by the construction of single family dwellings. The primary user of the property during the 20th century was the Tuf-Nut Garment Manufacturing Company. Founded by James D. Simpson and Vernon L.Jackson. The company made the popular Tuf-Nut jeans, overalls and shirts sold all across the South. The building was built in two phases-the first being a wood frame structure on the corner. The 3-story concrete addition was added later. The building is a classic, early 20th century'warehouse' vernacular structure with vent windows, a precast entrance and parapet detailing. Following the closing of the company in the late 1970's, the building served as a warehouse until 1999, when Moses Tucker Real Estate and Candy Bouquet International acquired it and renovated it into office space and 31 loft apartments. Retail space and 6 more apartments replaced the office in 2011. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Porbeck & Bowman Building	34.74745	-92.26616	History	Max Hilb and William Probst built this structure, designed by Joseph Willis, in 1882 for Probst & Hilb Liquor Company. The upper floor contained a two-story space that housed Concordia Hall, a Jewish social club. F. M. Fletcher and T.J. McCarthy purchased this building in 1909 and engaged architect Charles Thompson to convert the top story into two floors. Fletcher Coffee & Spice Company operated here until 1947. Purchased by George F. Porbeck in 1951, the building housed various businesses until Porbeck's heirs, including Herschel A. Bowman, leased it to the Budget Office Furniture Company in 1971. Capital improvement bonds approved by Little Rock voters in 2004 and 2007 made possible the adaptive reuse of the building by the Central Arkansas Library System. Construction was completed in February 2009.

Concordia Hall and Jewish Life in Little Rock	34.74747	-92.26637	History	From 1882 to 1887, an ornate two-story space on the second floor of this building served as the social hall for the Concordia Association an organization established in 1864 to help Jewish immigrant families adapt to their new lives in Arkansas. Despite religious segregation that prohibited Jews from belonging to most community-wide social organizations, many non-Jewish groups also used Concordia Hall for events. Brothers Jacob, Hyman and Levi Mitchell from Galicia became the first Jewish settlers in Little Rock in 1830. The establishment of Congregation B'nai Israel in Arkansas in 1866 affirmed the American principles of freedom of religion and assembly. At that time, more than 200 Jewish families lived in Little Rock, with most of their businesses located in this downtown area. Although statistically small, Little Rock's Jewish population has provided leaders in the business, educational, and philanthropic life of Little Rock, including the revitalization of the River Market District, which was aided by the Ottenheimer Foundation. This marker was placed with assistance from the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation and Temple B'Nai Israel.

TheLittle Rock	34.74904	-92.26658	History	A section of the'Little Rock' located at the foot of Rock Street forming the south pier of the railroad bridge over the Arkansas River, being the first rock seen by the French explorer, Bernard De La Harpe, on his voyage from the mouth of the Mississippi up the Arkansas in 1722. For 100 years prior to the founding of the town this rock marked the crossing of the north and south trail of the early settlers, the river being fordable at this point, and was known as the'Little Rock.' In 1821 Little Rock was made the capital of Arkansas territory, later when the territory became a state and admitted to the Union in 1836, the capital. The'Little Rock' is the N.W. Corner of the Quapaw Line surveyed after the signing of the treaty of cession between the Quapaw tribe and the United States June 24, 1818. Erected with the aid of officials of the city of Little Rock by The Civitan Club June 3rd 1932

Huntersville	34.75272	-92.26926	History	Arkansas's sole Civil War rail line, the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad, ran from DeValls Bluff to what is now North Little Rock. After U.S. troops occupied the capital in 1863, the Union army built warehouses, shops, and other railroad facilities on the north side of the Arkansas River. The area became known as Huntersville, possibly for Union railroad superintendent William Hunter. The Memphis and Little Rock Railroad took possession of the site in 1865 and three rail lines terminated there. The remnants of Huntersville burned in a May 1872 fire.

C.S.S. Pontchartrain	34.75275	-92.26861	History	The elegant steamboat Lizzie Simmons was built in 1859 and ran between Memphis and New Orleans until the Confederate Navy bought her in 1861 and converted her into a gunboat, the C.S.S. Pontchartrain. The vessel fought on the Mississippi River until ordered to serve on Arkansass rivers. Her crew fought at St. Charles and Arkansas Post, but the Pontchartrain remained at Little Rock, a threat to Union sailors. She was burned near here when Little Rock fell in 1863, though one of her cannons now sits in the front yard of the Old State House.

Action at Ashleys Station	34.78256	-91.74680	History	On Aug. 24, 1864, Confederate Gen. J.O. Shelby and his men, wearing captured Union uniforms, attacked a series of forts protecting hay-cutting operations between modern-day Carlisle and Hazen. Confederate artillery blasted the forts held by the 54th Illinois Infantry and 1st Nebraska Cavalry. As fresh Union troops arrived from DeValls Bluff, Shelby's men captured the forts' defenders while tearing up railroad tracks and destroying hay-cutting machines. The Confederates held off the reinforcements and left with 577 prisoners, losing only 173 casualties.

DeValls Bluff in the Civil War	34.78403	-91.45860	History	DeValls Bluff was strategically important to both the Union and Confederate armies as a major White River port and as head of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad. It became a key Union supply depot after its fall 1863 occupation, as well as a haven for refugees, both freedmen and white. Mounted Confederates operated around the town during 1864, attacking the railroad and Union troops on the nearby prairie. After the war ended, the Freedmens Bureau had an office in DeValls Bluff, aiding the newly freed African-Americans in the area.

Common Ground for Many Soldiers	34.78415	-91.45891	History	With the possible exception of Helena, it is unlikely that any place in Arkansas had as many Union troops pass through it as did DeValls Bluff. Some saw the town when it was first occupied in September 1863, others stood garrison duty there, while still others visited DeValls Bluff before embarking on raids and expeditions into other parts of Arkansas or Missouri. Thanks to Frederick Dyer's Compendium of the War of the Rebellion, we can compile a list of Union units that might have, however briefly, called DeValls Bluff home. Confederates in DeValls Bluff Confederate units that used DeValls Bluff are more difficult to identify since their records are sketchier and there is no Dyer's Compendium for the Confederacy. Still, it is likely that many Regiments passed through the town during 1861 and 1862, heading east to fight with Confederate armies on the far side of the Mississippi River. As many as 6,000 Confederate troops assembled around DeValls Bluff in June and July of 1862 to oppose Union troops moving up the White River. Still others passed through in the months before it became a permanent, strategic Union base. Several Texas units occupied DeValls Bluff. These include the 9th Field Artillery Battery, 9th Texas Infantry Regiment, 10th Texas Infantry Regiment, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 17th Cavalry Regiment, and 18th Infantry Regiment.

DeValls Bluff: A Key Union Base	34.78416	-91.45895	History	DEVALL'S BLUFF, ARKANSAS August 23, 1863. GENERAL: Having reconnoitered the different routes, I have decided to commence my line of operations at this point, and have moved the depot and hospital here to-day. The site chosen is a plateau (oak opening), high bluff on the river, and sloping on both sides, on one side a deep ravine. The two gunboats which are to remain here can defend the flanks, and an intrenchment can be thrown up in rear which will make the place tolerably secure against any force that will be likely to annoy us while we are pushing the enemy to the front. The buildings here do not amount to much, but there is considerable lumber, and, by sending to Clarendon for more, we can erect tolerable shelter for the sick and the supplies. Major General Frederick Steele With this report, DeValls Bluff began its role as a major Union base of operations. Steele's men soon built fortifications, a hospital, and a supply depot to support the Union army's drive to capture Little Rock. Once Union troops occupied the Arkansas capital, they had to be supplied army regulations specified that Steele's men should be issued 20 tons of rations every day, in addition to the 120 tons of fodder his 24,000 horses and mules would need daily. The best way to bring these mountains of supplies to the U.S. soldiers was via the White River, where they could be stored in warehouses constructed in DeValls Bluff before the railroad would take them to Little Rock. Dozens of storehouses, hospitals, and other government buildings were soon built, some using lumber taken from buildings in Des Arc. As the war progressed, thousands of Union soldiers were stationed in DeValls Bluff to protect those supplies and the railroad that carried them, as well as to conduct operations against Confederate troops and guerrillas in the surrounding area.

DeValls Bluff Under Fire	34.78418	-91.45871	History	DeValls Bluff's status as an excellent riverport and the head of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad made it an important base for both Confederate and Union forces. Hoping to block Federal ships from moving up the White River, Major Gen. Thomas C. Hindman fortified the site in June 1862 with two 8-inch guns, 1,000 infantrymen and 250 cavalry. Union troops skirmished with Confederate horsemen near DeValls Bluffs on July 6, but did not enter the town. After the battle of Arkansas Post in January 1863, a joint Army-Navy expedition steamed up the White River to attack Confederate positions. They arrived at DeValls Bluff on January 16 and captured the two 8-inch guns, 25 prisoners, dozens of new Enfield rifles, and other Confederate equipment. The Union troops burned the depot, several railroad cars and two railroad bridges. On August 10, 1863, another Union flotilla approached DeValls Bluff, surprising 12 Confederates who fled, leaving their equipment behind. Major General Frederick Steele's Union army occupied the town on August 23, and DeValls Bluff remained under Federal control for the rest of the war. Because of the concentration of Union troops there and on the adjacent prairie, Confederate cavalrymen who continue to attack Union targets including the railroad well into 1864.

War on the White River	34.78421	-91.45890	History	With a swift current and deep channel that allowed deeper-draft vessels to use it reliably as far north as Batesville, the White River was the most important river in Civil War Arkansas and was used extensively by both sides. The Confederate gunboats Pontchartrain and Maurepas moved up the White following the defeat of the Confederate fleet at Memphis on the Mississippi River on June 6, 1862. The Maurepas remains in the White River, scuttled at St. Charles. The Union navy patrolled the White River from the fall of 1863 until the end of the war. Using DeValls Bluff as a base, they often emerged in cat-and-mouse operations against Confederate troops and guerrillas in the area. Major Activities Along the White River On June 13, 1862, a Union fleet left Memphis to bring supplies to Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis's Army of the Southwest via the White River. On June 17, 1862, they encountered Confederate batteries at St. Charles, where a Rebel shell pierced the steam drum of the U.S.S. Mound City, scalding dozens of sailors to death. That artillery shell, called the single deadliest shot of the Civil War, caused 7 percent of the total fatal casualties suffered by the Union navy in the entire war. Falling water levels forced the flotilla to fall back without reaching Curtis. A Union Fleet used the White River Cutoff to enter the Arkansas River and crush the Confederate base at Arkansas Post January 9-11, 1863. On January 12, a joint Army-Navy expedition headed up the White River in pursuit of Confederate steamboats. They captured and partially burned St. Charles, destroyed Rebel supplies at DeValls Bluff, and captured and paroled 39 sick Confederates at Des Arc before returning downriver on the 19th. A Union flotilla met Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele's army at Clarendon on August 9, 1863, during Steele's drive to capture Little Rock. Part of the fleet advanced up the White River on August 12 to burn a warehouse full of Confederate supplies at Des Arc and briefly occupy Augusta, while the remainder moved up the Little Red River to capture a pair of steamboats. Confederate General J.O. Shelby operated in the area along the White River throughout the summer of 1864. On June 24, 1864 his cavalrymen slipped into Clarendon and found the U.S.S. Queen City at anchor. Shelby attacked and captured the vessel, sinking her after seizing supplies and weapons. A punitive expedition steamed down the White the next day, but the elusive Shelby slipped away. Union gunboats escorted Yankee infantrymen up the White on August 30, 1864, in pursuit of Shelby's Confederates. They advanced as far as Augusta, facing frequent sniping from gunmen along the shore, before returning to DeValls Bluff on September 6. The country along the bank [of the White River] is ... the wildest that I ever saw, being low-land covered with heavy forest of timber with cotton wood and cane underbrush ... I know not how circumscribed the limits of civilization in our enlightened land are, but I am inclined to believe from all manifestations that this part of Ark. is not found within her borders. Sgt. Asa E. Sample, 49th Indiana Infantry Regiment My feeble power of description is not capable of describing the awful scenes that met my eyes upon boarding the ill-fated vessel I immediately sent all the medical assistance at my command who did everything in their power to relieve the wounded, still 50 died within 4 hours after the accident happened ... Lt. George M. Blodgett, U.S.S. Conestoga, describing the U.S.S. Mound City at St. Charles In twenty minutes, after all that was valuable had been taken off, the earth reeled and trees trembled under the shock of the final destruction of the Queen City, and the waters closed over the remains of what had been two hours before a gallant mail-clad vessel.

Why DeValls Bluff	34.78428	-91.45873	History	DeValls Bluff was ideally situated to be an important location in the Civil War. The riverport was located at a point on the White River that was navigable at all seasons, a distinct advantage over Arkansas River sites that were frequently isolated by low water. DeValls Bluff also was the head of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad, which ran from there to present-day North Little Rock. Thus, people and supplies could be shipped by steamboat to DeValls Bluff, then transported by train to the capital at Little Rock. Union troops occupied DeValls Bluff in late August 1863 during the campaign to capture Little Rock, and it became a major supply depot for the remainder of the war. While the heavily fortified town itself never faced serious attack, the railroad line was a frequent target for Confederate raiders. DeVall's Bluff Through The Soldiers Eyes White River is at present a better one for the purpose of navigation than the Mississippi it is falling now, but will rise again next month, and can be depended upon all the time for over 4 feet of water to this point No pilot is required. All that is necessary is to keep a boat from running on the banks. With such a base as this, it will be a very easy matter to carry on operations against Little Rock. Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele DeValls Bluff August 23, 1863. This is a splendid sight for a town, and if in any of the Northern states, in as fine a country with a railroad connecting it with the interior and the best river for navigation in the United States of its size running past it, would have been a city of 25,000 inhabitants.

A Gun for All Reasons	34.78528	-91.89972	History	The 3-inch Ordnance Rifle was also known as the ordnance rifle, the ordnance gun, the Griffen gun, and was sometimes erroneously referred to as the Rodman rifle. The gun was invented by John Griffen, superintendent of the Safe Harbor Iron Works in Pennsylvania. His initial design was built by the Phoenix Iron Company of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, which manufactured most of the 3-inch Rifles used in the Union Armies. Griffen developed a process whereby strips of wrought iron 3/4 inches thick and 4 1/2 inches wide were wrapped around an iron core by a lathe. The tube was then heated and rolled to a length of seven feet before trunnions were welded on. Finally, a bore was reamed out. This process made the 3-inch Ordnance Rifle the lightest gun in field artillery service during the Civil War. Despite its light weight, the process of wrapping the wrought iron bands around the core made it the strongest, most durable gun in the field. The gun was deployed in support of infantry to repulse enemy assaults, often positioned behind the lines and fired over the heads of friendly troops. Range made the piece excellent for long-range shelling. Though its use was limited in wooded areas, it was accurate and lethal in open spaces. The rifle that stands before you was brought to the Lonoke County Courthouse before 1911 through the efforts of John Hallum, a soldier in the Civil War and a one time lawyer in Lonoke. Inset table of information U.S. M-1861 3-inch Ordnance Rifle Bore diameter 3 inches Tube composition Wrought Iron Length 73 inches Length of tube 69 inches Weight of tube 816 pounds Local stories about the rifle are that it was uned in the Brooks/Baxter War of 1874 and that it was taken from Federal forces and hidden in a bayou and nicknamed the Lady Furlow. It was restored in the 1920s in a blacksmith shop across from the courthouse. Little documented history of Rifle No. 705 can be found. However, guns of this type were in the area from September, 1863 to 1865, being deployed by such units as the Battery K, Second Missouri Light Artillery (US) and The Twenty-fifth Ohio Battery (US) in the Little Rock Campaign, including Browsville and Reed's Bridge. Inset table of information The Hotchkiss Shell (image actual size) Weight 9.5 pounds Powder charge 1 pound Range at 5° elev. 1,830 yards Muzzle velocity 1,215 ft./sec. This projectile was invented by Andrew Hotchkiss of Sharon, Connecticut, and patented October 16, 1855. This particular example is without its sabot or concussion fuze or percussion fuze (two different fuzes.) The technology of rifled artillery also produced a new kind of projectile that could travel greater distances with a higher degree of accuracy. In addition to the Hotchkiss Steel Shell, a 3 Inch Shenkle round was used under certain circumstances. This wayside exhibit was made possible by a generous gift from Arkansas Senator Bobby Glover (D)

A strong network of earthen works soon developed, including some in what is now Park Hill. Union Gen. Frederick Steele crossed the Arkansas east of the fortifications, however, leading Price to abandon them and the capital on Sept. 10, 1863, and retreat to southwest Arkansas . Union soldiers viewing the captured works deemed them well-built and formidable.

Memphis and Little Rock Railroad	34.78607	-91.45808	History	The Memphis and Little Rock Railroad was the first railroad to run in Arkansas. It was chartered in 1853, but when the Civil War began, only two sections were complete. One, running from DeValls Bluff to north of Little Rock, was finished in January 1862. Confederates used the M&LR to ship troops to Memphis, and it became a major asset to Union forces after DeValls Bluff was taken in 1863, carrying men and supplies from the White River to Little Rock. The M&LR proved a tempting target for Confederates, who attacked it frequently during 1864.

The Memphis and Little Rock Railroad	34.78610	-91.45805	History	On the eve of the Civil War, the Memphis to Little Rock Railroad had completed a line between Hopefield across the Mississippi River from Memphis and Madison in eastern Arkansas. A second section between DeValls Bluff and the north side of the Arkansas River across from Little Rock was finished by January 1862. These were the only rail lines in Arkansas. Confederate forces used the railroad to transport troops to fight east of the Mississippi until Memphis fell to Union forces in June 1862. The eastern section was little used after that. Union troops under Gen. Frederick Steele occupied DeValls Bluff in August 1863 and utilized the western stretch of the Memphis to Little Rock Railroad after Steele's troops occupied Little Rock on September 10, 1863. The line was the frequent target of attack and sabotage by Confederate cavalrymen as it crossed the vast prairies east of the capital. This railroad, from Devall's Bluff to Little Rock, is through a prairie country, it is built in almost a Straight line, with but a few bridges, and those over inconsiderable streams. It can be very easily kept in running order. Amos F. Eno, Secretary pro tem of Arkansas, and Adjutant-General January 13, 1863 The railroad from Devall's Bluff to Little Rock is in working order, and I am now sending two engines around, to be used after taking Little Rock, and until the Arkansas rises that command can be supplied by White River and the railroad. Maj. Gen. Stephen Hurlbut September 9, 1863 The immediate and tangible fruits of my expedition are 577 prisoners, including 1 field officer and 11 line officers over 200 Federals killed and wounded ten miles of railroad track destroyed completely--the ties torn up and burned, the iron heated and bent, telegraph destroyed, bridges and trestle-works ruined 3,000 bales of hay destroyed by fire 20 hay machines chopped to pieces 5 forts razed to the ground 500 stand of small-arms distributed to my unarmed men many fine horses captured 12 barrels of salt brought off the field and given to a command suffering for it, besides supplying many needy soldiers with blankets, shoes, boots, hats, and clothing. All this was done within six miles of Devall's Bluff, and my detail was tearing up the track while the enemy's bullets, fired at the covering regiments, were throwing the splinters from the ties in their very faces.

William H. Fuller	34.78650	-91.74600	History	Left Side Hot Spring's reputation as a health and recreation resort attracting the rich and famous was certainly true in the late 1800's and well into the 20th century. The city had fine hotels, lively nightclubs, a beautiful mountain setting, and the famous hot water from the natural springs. In 1886, Cap Anson brought his Chicago White Stockings (now the Cubs) to Hot Springs. This bustling turn-of-the-century spa resort with its famous hot baths, mountains, trails, hotels, and activities was the perfect place for something no one had ever heard of: spring training for professional baseball. Soon, teams had built five fields and as many as 250 players, including the legends of the game, trained here year after year. Now you can follow The Hot Springs Baseball Trail and stand where legends stood and records were set. Read and hear stories of the players and places that shaped baseball. Pick up a guide map at the Hot Springs Visitor Center in Hill Wheatley Plaza on Central Avenue, at the Alligator Farm, or at Oaklawn Racetrack. Each Baseball Trail marker has a digital'code' that can link to your smartphone to historic photos, audio and more. With a phone call you can hear stories of the golden age of baseball in Hot Springs.

Memphis and Little Rock Railroad	34.78650	-91.45785	History	The Memphis and Little Rock Railroad was the first railroad to run in Arkansas. It was chartered in 1853, but when the Civil War began, only two sections were complete. One, running from DeValls Bluff to north ofLittle Rock, was finished in January 1862. Confederates used the M&LR to ship troops to Memphis, and it became a major asset to Union forces after DeValls Bluff was taken in 1863, carrying men and supplies from the White River to Little Rock. The M&LR proved a tempting target for Confederates, who attacked it frequently during 1864.

DeValls Bluff: A Major Union Riverport	34.78722	-91.45621	History	Rising from the Boston Mountains, the White River meanders 720 miles to its junction with the Arkansas River in the southeastern part of the state. The fast-moving water kept the White River from suffering the build-up of silt that made such rivers as the Arkansas difficult to traverse for much of the year. The White River could accommodate deeper-draft vessels than most other rivers in the state. With its tall bluffs towering over the White River, DeValls Bluff was easily defendable and became the most important port on the river during the Civil War. Union gunboats could easily travel to the town, providing security for the steamboats carrying supplies that would then be transferred for railroad transport to Little Rock. (Upper Image Caption) The steamboat Des Arc was moored at DeValls Bluff when cotton in her hold caught fire on March 22, 1864. The U.S.S. Signal towed her across the river to protect other vessels docked nearby and, when the flames grew out of control, sank her with cannon fire. The Des Arc was later raised and continued serving as a White River packet until 1871. Courtesy, Arkansas History Commission. (Lower Left Image Caption) The U.S.S. Signal, U.S.S. Romeo, U.S.S. Fawn and U.S.S. Marmora were some of the Union gunboats that plied the waters of the White River, seeking Confederate targets and protecting cargo and troop transports.

The Old Mill at T. R. Pugh Memorial Park	34.79121	-92.24930	History	Dedicated August 6, 1933, as Pugh's Memorial Park, the Old Mill is a replica of an abandoned water-powered grist mill that would have been used by Arkansas pioneers in the 1800s. Although the Old Mill never actually operated as a mill, the iron grist mill on the first floor of the building is authentic and dates to 1828. It served the Cagle family of Pope County for three generations. Developer Justin Matthews intended for the Old Mill to appear as the ruins of a bygone era supplanted by modern methods.'Now completely forgotten by the hurrying world around it, the Old Mill quietly weathers the years in the depths of its secluded valley,' Matthews said of his vision. A memorial to his friend and business partner, Thomas R. Pugh of Portland, Arkansas, the Old Mill with its wheel turning symbolizes Pugh's tireless energy. Millstones on the second floor of the building came from the Ashley County plantation of Tom Knoble, Pugh's grandfather. Frank Carmean of the Matthews Company designed the park and Bob Massey supervised the project. Matthews commissioned Dionicio Rodriguez, a noted Mexican sculptor, whose faux bois (or fake wood) style was perfected in the details of this remarkable work of art. The Old Mill appeared in the opening credits of the 1939 movie, Gone With the Wind.

Leaving the next morning, the Union command divided for the return to Helena. Bands of Confederate horsemen hit one Union column repeatedly, wounding 22 men though 15 Confederates were captured and many killed.

The two generals were at odds over actions at Helena and Brownsville earlier in 1863. Marmaduke's transfer was approved, but after a series of messages passed between the generals' staffs, Walker issued a challenge to a duel. The officers met at dawn on Sept. 6, armed with Navy Colts. Both fired and missed, then Marmaduke fatally wounded Walker, who died the next day after forgiving the man who shot him.

Scott County in the Civil War	34.90009	-94.09150	History	While Scott County residents were divided on the issue of secession, once Arkansas left the Union, many supported the Confederacy. The first fighting there was a Sept. 11, 1863, skirmish near Waldron where the 14th Kansas lost 1 dead and 2 wounded while 1 Confederate was hurt. The 3rd Wisconsin Cavalry fought near there on Oct. 6. Waldron became a U.S. base. Union scouting parties from Waldron ventured toward Mount Ida, Caddo Gap and Dallas, and down Dutch Creek during December, when 1,500 troops from Arkansas, Kansas and Indiana occupied the town. On Dec. 29, 1863, Confederates under Maj. Gibson attacked an outpost of 2nd Kansas Cavalry men at Waldron. Gibson died and 8 of his men were wounded, while 1 Kansan died and 6 were hurt defending their post. After another U.S. soldier was wounded in a Feb. 1, 1864, skirmish, Union commanders chose to abandon Waldron and burned most of the town as they left. The last skirmish in Scott Co. was fought June 19, 1864, when 250 men of the 6th, 9th and 14th Kansas Cavalry attacked around 500 troops of Wells Texas Cavalry at Hons Farm, routing them.

Lt. Harris also became ill. He retired from the Army because of his poor health and died May 18, 1837, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire at age 32.
Cherokee Memorial	35.10393	-92.54494	History	Following is a partial list of persons who died and were buried at Cadron. They perished from cholera while being relocated by the Army in 1834. Graves were marked with native stones with no inscriptions. Some of the Indians had adopted Christianity and customs of whites. Some had assumed AngloSaxon names. Before 1850 it was common for Cherokee children to be unnamed until after their seventh birthday, hence the lack of given names for the children. ___Bird' Alex M'Toy's Child ___Bird's Wife' Thigh Nave ___Brewer's Child' J.

Trail of Tears	35.10393	-92.54494	History	After Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, May 28, 1830, the Government forceably relocated about 60,000 Indians from the southeastern U.S. to what is now Oklahoma. This included the five (5) civilized tribes Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole. When Andrew Jackson ran for president in 1828, he pledged to move the Indians west of the Mississippi River. After removal became law, the government proceeded to relocate the Indians. Some traveled overland and others by water. Many suffered severe hardships. About 14,000 Cherokees were relocated with 4,000 deaths occurring. The grief from their loved one's deaths, the hardships, and deprivations, made their trek westward indeed a Trail of Tears.
Cadron Blockhouse	35.10397	-92.54492	History	The blockhouse is a replica of a structure that was built on this site in the late 18th century. The building was a multiple use structure, but constructed originally for defense purposes. It was used as a trading post, as a residence, and as a public gathering place. When the French trappers and other early settlers were in this area, the Osage Indians occupied the land north of the Arkansas River. When the Osage were on the warpath, the settlers used the blockhouse as a place for refuge. The blockhouse is refered to in some of the French and Spanish journals and other early records. In the early 1800's the John McElmurry Family owned the property and occupied the blockhouse as a residence. The reconstruction was a joint venture of the Conway Chamber of Commerce and the Faulkner County Historical Society in cooperation with the U.S. Corps of Engineers.

Lewisburg in the Civil War	35.14208	-92.73570	History	While a Confederate unit, the Conway Mounted Rifles, formed at Lewisburg in May 1861, the town was a Union base for much of the war. A garrison was established Sept. 28, 1863, and Col. Abraham H. Ryan recruited the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry (U.S.) there. The base was on high ground, with cannon aimed at Lewisburg with fortifications along the streets. Officers boarded at the Gordon Anderson house in town. In 1864 a smallpox epidemic ravaged the garrison and nearly 100 Union soldiers died of it and other camp diseases that the regiment suffered. The 3rd Arkansas fought against guerrillas mainly, but abandoned Lewisburg twice in 1864 when large bodies of Confederates came into the area. The regiment mustered out at Lewisburg on June 30, 1865. A Freedmen's Bureau office opened in June 1866 to aid freed people with labor contracts and to run a school. In 1868 the town was embroiled in conflict between the Ku Klux Klan and the Republican militia during voter registration. Parts of Lewisburg were burned twice during December, and Gov. Powell Clayton declared martial law in Conway County on Dec. 8, 1868.

A National Cemetery System	35.38431	-94.42854	History	Civil War Dead An estimated 700,000 Union and Confederate soldiers died in the Civil War between April 1861 and April 1865. As the death toll rose, the U.S. government struggled with the urgent but unplanned need to bury fallen Union troops. This propelled the creation of a national cemetery system. On September 11, 1861, the War Department directed commanding officers to keep'accurate and permanent records of deceased soldiers.' It also required the U.S. Army Quartermaster General, the office responsible for administering to the need of troops in life and in death, to mark each grave with a headboard. A few months later, the department mandated interment of the dead in graves marked with numbered headboards, recorded in a register. [Photo caption reads] Soldiers' graves near General Hospital, City Point, Va., c. 1863 Library of Congress. Creating National Cemeteries The authority to create military burial grounds came in an Omnibus Act of July 17, 1862. It directed the president to purchase land to be used as'a national cemetery for the soldiers who shall die in the service of the country.' Fourteen national cemeteries were established by 1862. When hostilities ended, a grim task began. In October 1865, Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs directed officers to survey lands in the Civil War theater to find Union dead and plan to reinter them in new national cemeteries. Cemetery sites were chosen where troops were concentrated: camps, hospitals, battlefields, railroad hubs. By 1872, 74 national cemeteries and several soldiers' lots contained 305,492 remains, about 45 percent were unknown. [Photo caption reads] Knoxville [National Cemetery] was established after the siege of the city and Battle of Fort Sanders in 1863. Cemetery plan, 1892, National Archives and Records Administration. Most cemeteries were less than 10 acres, and layouts varied. In the Act to Establish and to Protect National Cemeteries of February 22, 1867, Congress funded new permanent walls or fences, grave markers, and lodges for cemetery superintendents. At first only soldiers and sailors who died during the Civil War were buried in national cemeteries. In 1873, eligibility was expanded to all honorably discharged Union veterans, and Congress appropriated $1 million to mark the graves. Upright marble headstones honor individuals whose names were known 6-inch-square blocks mark unknowns. By 1873, military post cemeteries on the Western frontier joined the national cemetery system. The National Cemeteries Act of 1973 transferred 82 Army cemeteries, including 12 of the original 14, to what is now the National Cemetery Administration. [Photo caption reads] Lodge at City Point, Va., pre-1928. The first floor contained a cemetery office, and living room and kitchen for the superintendent's family three bedrooms were upstairs. Reflection and Memorialization The country reflected upon the Civil War's human toll 2 percent of the U.S. population died. Memorials honoring war service were built in national cemeteries. Most were donated by regimental units, state governments and veterans' organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic. Decoration Day, later Memorial Day, was a popular patriotic spring event that started in 1868. Visitors placed flowers on graves and monuments, and gathered around rostrums to hear speeches. Construction of Civil War monuments peaked in the 1890s. By 1920, as the number of aging veterans was dwindling, more than 120 monuments had been placed in the national cemeteries.

Confederate Burials in the National Cemetery	35.38433	-94.42847	History	The Confederate Occupation The War Department established Fort Smith in 1817 and occupied it until April 23, 1861. Learning that the Arkansas militia was advancing, the garrison retreated, taking arms and supplies from the fort with them. Hours later, Arkansas Volunteers led by Col. Solon Borland, a former U.S. senator, marched into Fort Smith and took possession in the name of the state of Arkansas. Fort Smith's location, transportation and communications network, and storage facilities made it an important supply depot. Over the next thirty months, Confederates launched military expeditions from this location. As the Union army approached Fort Smith on August 31, 1863, the Confederates withdrew. During the occupation, Confederates buried their soldiers in the existing post cemetery. In 1867, the post cemetery was designated Fort Smith National Cemetery. [Photo captions read] Solon Borland, Democratic Senator from Arkansas, 1848-1853. Library of Congress. Fort Smith, Arkansas, c. 1855. Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. The Confederate Monument Sometime after Fort Smith National Cemetery was established, former Confederate general James F. Fagan and Dr. Elias Duval decided to erect a memorial here honoring Confederate dead buried in the cemetery including Gens. Alexander E. Steen and James McIntosh. Fagan and Duval, aided by the women of Fort Smith, raised money for the memorial and sometime before 1898,'a modest, yet appropriate shaft' was erected in Section 2. A tornado in January 1898 destroyed the memorial and caused considerable damage to the cemetery. The United Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy raised money to replace the monument, and in 1901 they submitted the design to the War Department. The design was rejected because the inscription violated government policy that text be'without praise and without censure.' The proposed monument was eventually erected on the Sebastian County courthouse lawn, where it stands today. About 1904, the War Department replaced the destroyed monument with a small marble obelisk. [Photo captions read] James F. Fagan, c. 1880. Arkansas History Commission.

Fort Smith National Cemetery The largest group of Confederate burials in Fort Smith National Cemetery is in Section 3 other interments are scattered throughout Sections 1, 2, 4 and 8. Many graves contain two or more burials, and some as many as thirty individuals. [Photo caption reads] Confederate headstones, c. 1934, with the Southern Cross of Honor.

That year, the War Department authorized the addition of the Southern Cross of Honor to the Confederate headstone. The United Daughters of the Confederacy created the cross medal in 1898 and bestowed it upon Confederate veterans or their families. The emblem on the headstone is a simplified version of what appears on the medal. To learn more about benefits and programs for Veterans and families, visit. www.va.gov

Fort Smith National Cemetery	35.38437	-94.42840	History	Civil War Fort Smith In 1817, the U.S. Army sent a detachment of soldiers to Arkansas Territory to keep the peace between the Osage and Cherokee nations. They built a post on the shore of the Arkansas River and named it for Gen. Thomas A. Smith. The army abandoned Fort Smith in 1825 but returned in 1836. A federal garrison held Fort Smith until April 23, 1861, when the Arkansas militia seized it. Union forces retook the fort in September 1863 and held it for the rest of the war. Fort Smith became an important supply depot and outpost at the edge of Indian Territory. In 1865, a council meeting at Fort Smith was held to negotiate between the federal government and tribes that had sided with the Confederacy. The council reestablished treaties between those tribes and the government. [Photo caption reads] Fort Smith, 1865. Courtesy of the Fort Smith National Historic Site. National Cemetery Post Surgeon Thomas Russell, who died in 1819, was the first interment at Fort Smith. The 5.5-acre cemetery served the garrisons, both Union and Confederate, during the Civil War. In 1867, it became one of three national cemeteries established in Arkansas. In addition to U.S. soldiers, burials include several hundred Confederates and more than 160 civilians who died at the fort. In the 1870s, the U.S. Army Quartermaster General's office constructed a brick lodge and wall, and placed permanent marble headstones on the graves. In 1898, a tornado swept through Fort Smith and caused extensive damage. The wall was rebuilt in stone, and the lodge was replaced with the current two-story building in 1904. When a new entrance was erected in 1942, the old iron gates were moved into the cemetery. Over the years, the cemetery has expanded to more than 32 acres. [Photo caption reads] The lodge in 1941. National Archives and Records Administration. Judge Parker Isaac Charles Parker was born on October 15, 1838, in Ohio. In 1859, he became a lawyer and moved to St. Joseph, Missouri. Parker resigned from his position as city attorney in 1861 to join the Union Army. After the Civil War, he was elected county prosecutor and later served two terms in the U.S. Congress. On March 18, 1875, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him judge of the Western District of Arkansas, based in Fort Smith. Judge Parker held court six days a week, often hearing cases for ten hours each day. He presided over an unusually large number of cases with a mandatory death sentence. Although personally opposed to capital punishment, federal law required Parker to hand down the death sentence if the jury returned a guilty verdict for crimes of rape or murder. Parker served until shortly before his death on November 17, 1896, and was buried in this cemetery (Section 9, Grave 4000). In the years after his death he was often referred to as the'Hanging Judge.' [Photo caption reads] Isaac C. Parker, c. 1875. Library of Congress.

Lincolns Gettysburg Address	35.38443	-94.42813	History	Address by President Lincoln at the dedication of The Gettysburg National Cemetery November 19, 1863 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

The New Theatre in 1911	35.38456	-94.42148	History	Ten years before the outbreak of the Civil War, the Old Red Mill stood on the future site of the New Theatre. The mill was used as a hospital during the Civil War, was damaged by the 1898 cyclone and finally disappeared around 1908. On the back section of the property the George T. Sparks estate built the 1,200 seat New Theatre in 1911. Designed as a Beaux Arts style playhouse by Kansas City architect Carl Boller, modeled after the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City. The lavish interior featuring a proscenium stage was ideal for vaudeville shows and silent movies with orchestral accompaniment. In 1922, retail shops and a long Garrison Avenue entrance were built, nicknamed Peacock Alley, a place to see and be seen. In 1942, the theater was sold to Malco Theaters, Inc., who changed the name and modernized the interior space. The Malco Theater operated until the late 1970s when single screen theaters became passe.

Out of the western skies on an unusually balmy night came first an epic show of lightning followed by heavy winds. Then with the roar of a thousand freight trains a tornado of great proportion sprang from the Indian Territory, leaping over the Arkansas River and striking first at the National Cemetery then turning its force on Garrison Avenue, cutting a mile-long, 500 yard swath of destruction through Fort Smith. Property damage was placed at half a million dollars. As a beautiful morning dawned on January 12th, 55 people were dead or dying and 113 were seriously injured.

The Phoenix Block	35.38741	-94.42575	History	From 1836 to 1878, the log cabin of Jeremiah and Sophia Kannady stood on the present-day 500 block of Garrison Avenue. In that cabin Kannady's uncle John Rogers, founder of the city, died in 1860. In 1877, Kannady sold land around his cabin to make room for new commercial buildings. A wood-frame building at Garrison and North 5th was occupied by Berman's Dry Goods, when a two-story brick building for the confectioners Guler & Brunoldi and the general merchandise store of Haglin & Pape was completed next to it in Sept. 1877. More buildings would be built east to the alley. A unified brick complex nicknamed the Phoenix Block rose from the ashes and was completed by April 1884. The elegant cornices of galvanized iron were manufactured in Fort Smith by August Reichert.

First National Bank	35.38745	-94.42533	History	In 1888, First National Bank built its first bank building, a modest two-story brick building at South Sixth and Garrison. A few years into the 20th century, bank president Samuel McLoud ordered plans drawn up for what would be the tallest building in Fort Smith to replace the old bank. The new building would utilize the most modern designs to ensure customer comfort, efficiency of operation and the protection of deposits. The landmark eight-story First National Bank building opened Jan. 31, 1910, the lobby awash in white marble, electric lights and ceiling fans, the custom tile floor accessorized with heavy brass spittoons. One hundred years later, First National Bank remained our largest financial institution and the second oldest bank in Arkansas.

The Commissary Storehouse	35.38762	-94.42908	History	This is the oldest building still standing in Fort Smith. Originally built as part of a larger fortification, over the years its appearance and use changed dramatically. The building held supplies used by explorers and soldiers, played a crucial role in two wars, and served as an office for Federal Judge Isaac C. Parker. Today the commissary is furnished with reproductions of supplies that the U.S. Army stored here in the 1850s. A number of posts located farther west benefited from these rations. As part of Fort Smith National Historic Site, the commissary building helps tell one dimension of Fort Smith's rich and varied history

The Gallows	35.38767	-94.43012	History	With the largest criminal jurisdiction of any federal court at the time, the Western District of Arkansas handled an extraordinary number of murder and rape cases. When a jury found defendants guilty in these capital cases, federal law mandated the death penalty. In Fort Smith, that meant an execution by hanging on a crude and unsightly gallows. A visitor to the city in 1893 recommended constructing a new gallows to evoke the sacredness and majesty of the law. This was never achieved and a year after the last execution, the city of Fort Smith destroyed the gallows structure. I do not desire to hang you men. It is the law. Judge Isaac C. Parker

Executions at Fort Smith	35.38768	-94.43015	History	During the twenty-four years the federal executions took place in Fort Smith, eighty-seven men died on the gallows. While Judge Isaac C. Parker sat on the bench, 160 people, including four women, were sentenced to hang. Just over half received a reprieve from execution through pardons, commutations, reversals or acquittals on appeal, or death in jail. The men listed below were hanged in Fort Smith.

Fort Wall	35.38779	-94.43076	History	Security has always been a concern for the U.S. military. The army designed the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) as part of a line of forts from Minnesota to Louisiana to separate the territory occupied by Native American tribes from that settled by American citizens. To provide protection in the event of an attack, military engineers called for the construction of a fort with five bastions (gun emplacements), and a massive stonewall that was 12 feet high and 2 feet thick. Fort Smith represents the last of a dying breed from the 1840s on, virtually all frontier forts were built without walls. After Fort Smith was built, the cost of constructing a wall was considered too great in comparison to the benefit of a fortified defense. The fort walls remained in place throughout the federal court era (1872-1897), affording a level of security for proceedings and the executions that took place. Today the location of the original wall is outlined by continuous band of stones.

Defending Freedom	35.38791	-94.43051	History	I never saw such fighting done as was done by the negro regiment The question that negroes will fight is settled besides they make better soldiers in every respect than any troops I have ever had under my command. General Blunt after the Battle of Honey Springs, July 17, 1863. Black infantry drilled on the parade ground in front of you. At various times during the Civil War, Fort Smith housed four regiments of U.S. Colored Troops (USCT). One was organized locally. Drills increased after Confederate soldiers mercilessly massacred black troops who had surrendered at Poison Springs in 1864. Many of the troops were former slaves. Later that year, the 11th USCT, on duty in Indian Territory, battled Confederate cavalry in one of many skirmishes fought by Fort Smith troops. By war's end about 10 percent of all Union troops were USCT regiments.
Confederate [and] Union Occupation of Fort Smith	35.38802	-94.42872	History	[Side A] On April 23, 1861, the U.S. garrison at Fort Smith abandoned the post as Confederate militiamen approached. Fort Smith became an important recruiting and training center for Confederate forces in west Arkansas. Troops from Fort Smith fought at Wilson's Creek, Mo., in 1861, and participated in the battle of Pea Ridge March 7-8, 1862. Confederate Gen. Thomas C. Hindman led an army from Fort Smith to the bloody combat at Prairie Grove on Dec. 7, 1862. The post remained under Confederate control until Union forces took Fort Smith Sept. 1, 1863. [Side B] On Sept. 1, 1863, U.S. troops under Gen. James Blunt seized Ft. Smith. It remained a Union post for the duration of the war. Fort Smith became a haven for white war refugees and former slaves, many of whom joined the Union army. Fort Smith troops fought in the 1864 Camden Expedition, but most local fighting focused on guerrilla units infesting the area. In the summer of 1864, Union troops withstood a series of Confederate attacks from the Indian Territory. Soldiers and civilians faced a supply shortage until peace came in 1865.

Welcome to Fort Smith	35.38817	-94.42898	History	Founded in 1817 by the U.S. Army to contain a volatile Indian feud, Fort Smith later served as a major supply depot for western military posts, and finally as headquarters of the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas. For over 80 years, the federal government used Fort Smith to establish and maintain law and order in the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). Fort Smith National Historic Site preserves the remains of these two military posts and the federal court. During your visit, make sure to visit the following locations at the park.

Confederates Occupy The Fort	35.38823	-94.43004	History	At the beginnings of the Civil War, amid the firing of cannon and the cheers of the people, a local newspaper reported, Arkansas State Militia raised the Confederate flag and took control of Fort Smith on April 23, 1861. With the Confederate victory in South Carolina at Fort Sumter, the U.S. War Department ordered all southern forts abandoned. Despite pleas of concerned citizens, U.S. troops (later called Union troops) left Fort Smith just an hour before state militia arrived. The transition took place without conflict. While Arkansas militia troops controlled the fort, citizens of Fort Smith and the surrounding region remained deeply divided. Many pro-Unionist kept silent, suppressed their loyalties, or left town. After Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863 followed by Confederate defeat west of Fort Smith at Honey Springs, Union forces reclaimed Fort Smith in September 1863.
W.J. Murphy - Eads Brothers Building in 1903	35.38824	-94.42704	History	The first mention of this property is from 1838 when it was part of the brickyard that manufactured bricks to build the second Fort Smith. In 1877 the City Hotel was built here. In 1897, identical buildings were constructed to house the W.J. Murphy Harness and Saddlery Company at 410-12 Garrison. In 1901, Charles and Louis Eads established Eads Brothers Furniture Company in the former Rodgers-Wade building. In 1923, Eads Brothers purchased the Murphy building, removing the walls and combining the buildings. After 95 years in the same location, Eads Brothers relocated not long before the April 21, 1996 tornado hit downtown Fort Smith and Van Buren. The Eads Brothers building survived with minor damage but three days later on April 24, the building exploded into flames soon after the utilities services were reconnected. Three other adjacent businesses were destroyed in the ensuing fire.

Clues from the Past	35.38830	-94.42950	History	The building in front of you is very much as it appeared in the 1890s. First used as a military barracks, it was later converted for use as a courthouse and jail. Over time its appearance changed to accommodate the different needs of the people using it. Between 1851 and 1887, the structure was 1 189 stories with large porches. The second story of the courthouse was added in 1891 for use as a hospital for the prisoners, and the long porches were removed and replaced with shorter ones. Historical accounts note that the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) had three water wells. The only one that has been located is under the circular patch of grass in front of you. Sheltered by the small gazebo visible in the photo, this well supplied water throughout much of the building's history. After 1870, the well was replaced by other water sources such as cisterns and water pumped from the river. Look at the historic photographs and compare them to the building you see today. Notice clues of its former appearance by examining bricked in windows, remnants of porch foundations, changing roof lines, and brick color variations.

The Officers Quarters	35.38831	-94.43056	History	You are now standing on what was once Officer's Row at the second Fort Smith. From 1846 to 1865, two large buildings stood on the western edge of the parade ground and provided housing for officers and their families. Unlike the cramped quarters of the enlisted men's barracks, there was a degree of privacy here. Large front and back porches, yards, and gardens surrounded by picket fences provided further domestic comforts. Fire destroyed both Officer's Quarters in 1865 and 1870. In 2000, the National Park Service placed the concrete pads here to show the approximate locations and floor plans of both buildings. The Cistern Following the Civil War, the U.S. Army constructed a dome-shaped cistern between the two officer's quarters. This underground storage tank is 22 feet deep and holds 55,000 gallons of water. The cistern, enlisted men's barracks and the commissary are the only structures remaining from the second Fort period (1838-1871). Captain Samuel Sturgis, Commander at Fort Smith, 1859-1861, Officer's wives and children shared the trials and tribulations of military life with their husbands and fathers. At Fort Smith, Sturgis' son, Jack was badly burned when two other boys accidentally exploded twelve pounds of gunpowder. Jack carried a facial scar until his death as a lieutenant at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.
Meeting of Nations	35.38843	-94.42982	History	The Fort Smith Council was held in this building in September 1865. To establish relations following the Civil War, delegates of twelve Indian nations met with President Andrew Johnson's representatives. Bitterly divided, Indians had fought for both sides in the war, but the United States now treated them all as defeated enemies. Tribes were told their rights had been forfeited, their slaves must be freed, and their property could be confiscated. The Council ended with little resolved. Not expecting to sign treaties, and concerned that tribal sovereignty was at stake, the Indians simply pledged allegiance to the United States.

The Fishback Block in 1872	35.38848	-94.42684	History	In 1870, ground was broken for the three-story Fishback Block on the site of Jeremiah Kannady's blacksmith shop which manufactured Bowie knives for the Confederate Army. The builder, future Gov. William Meade Fishback (1831-1903), named the 7,000 square foot third floor ballroom after his wife, Adelaide Miller Fishback. Adelaide Hall quickly became the scene of grand balls, beautiful dinner parties, wedding receptions, public meetings and firey political gatherings. City Hall was relocated here. In 1885 the building burned to the ground. Fishback's new two-story building in the same style would be named Adelaide Hall in honor of his wife who had died three years earlier. 110 years later, Adelaide Hall was purchased and completely restored by Richard and Jaunice Griffin.

Vogel & Wallace	35.38856	-94.42690	History	In December 1878, Teddy Vogel and Michael C. Wallace bought the old rough hewn log store building and home that had been been [sic] constructed on this lot circa 1845 by Samuel Boothe. They razed the log structure and began building a stout, stone building. The newspaper gave periodic updates of the rock walls going up and giving thanks that the'wretched rookeries' on this corner were being replaced by the'fine rock business house' being erected by those'two young and successful enterprising merchants, Vogel & Wallace.' Business was so good that Vogel & Wallace moved to a new location in the 500 block of Garrison Avenue in 1883. Then 73 Garrison, as it was numbered in those days, was rented by Robert Henry Gannaway, the 2nd of three generations of Gannaway photographers. Postmaster and future District Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas James K. Barnes purchased the building in 1882 and from 1885 to 1887 the Federal Post Office occupied this building while the new Federal Courthouse and Post Office was built on South 6th Street. Gabriel Mone, an Italian immigrant, bought the building and opened a saloon in 1887. His son Joe was convicted of selling liquor to the Indians in 1890. By 1892 Gabriel went back to Ohio. After Joe Mone was released from prison he became a lifelong worker at the Immaculate Conception Church. Will Wirsing had a gun shop here for 1894-1900, but with a few exceptions this building was used as a bar, saloon or liquor store into the 21st century. Fort Smith Weekly New Era. Fort Smith, Arkansas, Wednesday, August 20, 1879. Removal The undersigned have just removed to their new, elegant, fireproof store corner Green Street and Garrison Avenue a few doors below their old stand and we invite our old patrons as well as the rest of mankind to give us a call and see us in our new quarters.

Marble Hall in 1863	35.38861	-94.42753	History	Marble Hall, the oldest building on Garrison Avenue, was built in 1859 by Ethelbert Britton Bright. Judging from the surviving newspapers ads, his mercantile store held the very wonders of the world, steadily supplied by steamboats docking at the foot of Garrison. The son of a missionary to the Osage tribe, Bright became fluent in their language. He came to Fort Smith in 1853 and set forth in business at a lightning pace. By 1857, he ran the Old Red Mill on Tenth Street, had married the niece of Stand Waite and built a mansion on Sixth Street. Marble Hall was used as a hospital during the Civil War. By 1862, Bright had enlisted in the 51st Arkansas Militia Regiment. Bright returned from the war and launched back into business but his obituary notes that he met with reverses and lived quietly until his death in 1890. Marble Hall has housed many businesses including a shooting gallery in 1900. Marble Hall was restored by Phil White in 1977.

Officers Garden	35.38881	-94.43007	History	The walls were almost hidden by a wealth of vines and foliage, and the enclosed space was as green as nature and care could make it. Beautiful flower beds were kept well tended by the soldiers and added greatly to the beauty of the grounds.' Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling Fort Smith in the 1850s A garden provided many benefits to the soldiers and their families at Fort Smith. Fresh vegetables in the garden behind the officer's quarters provided a healthy addition to their daily diet. Herbs were used as seasoning and medicine. Flowers brightened an otherwise monotonous fort life. Working in the garden was part of the daily routine for officers' wives and children. The garden also served as a pleasant gathering place for friends and family.

The Flagstaff	35.38882	-94.42941	History	The U.S. Army built the original flagstaff at the second Fort Smith in 1846. As with many western military posts, the flagstaff stood tall so that its flag could be seen for miles. To attain a height of nearly 100 feet, the army joined two poles in the same way that ship masts were built. Historically, shroud lines attached to cross trees supported the area where the poles were joined, while guidelines and an underground wooden structure stabilized the base. When the army closed Fort Smith in 1871, they removed the flagstaff. The Old Fort Militia, a local citizen support group, in cooperation with the National Park Service rebuilt the flagstaff in 1984-85. Its 37-star flag is a replica of the last flag flown here by the army, from 1867-1871.

The Womens Jail, 1872-1888	35.38897	-94.42927	History	After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the guardhouse served the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas. It remained in use as a jail, detaining primarily women suspected or convicted of federal crimes until 1888. At that time, the court moved quarters for female prisoners into the courthouse/jail building. Although not as numerous as their male counterparts, female prisoners were no novelty in Fort Smith. They committed the same crimes as men in the Indian Territory, ranging from illegal sale of whiskey to murder. When convicted, they received the same sentences fines, jail time or death by hanging. From 1873 through 1874 the guardhouse also briefly functioned as Death Row by holding the men condemned to die on the gallows.

The Guardhouse, 1849-1871	35.38903	-94.42935	History	The guardhouse, constructed in 1849, was a focal point of daily activity at the second Fort Smith. Not only did the men assigned to guard detail operate out of this building, but the officer of the day, who was responsible for the daily business of the post, worked out of an office located here. The guardhouse was also the place of confinement for soldiers under arrest for such offenses as drunkenness, desertion, or fighting. The Guard Mount, or changing of the guard ceremony, occurred here once a day usually about 9:00 a.m. At the time, the old guard detail would be inspected and mustered out, and the new guard detail would be inspected and mustered in. Members of the guard detail served as sentries throughout the fort grounds, at each gate, and watched prisoners in the guardhouse.

The Bastion That Never Was	35.38904	-94.42987	History	When army engineers originally designed the second Fort Smith in 1838, they planned for it to withstand attack. A key feature in achieving this goal was a stone wall about twelve feet high and from two to three feet thick. This wall surrounded the buildings of the second fort. At the five corners of the wall the army intended to construct bastions, two-story fortified firing positions for cannons. Construction on this bastion began in March of 1839 by 1842 the foundation of the structure was nine feet high and five feet thick. Quartermaster General Thomas Jesup inspected Fort Smith in 1845 and ordered this fortification converted into a commissary depot. General Jesup's intervention led to Fort Smith's continued growth by shifting the mission of the post from defense to supply. With supply as its primary mission, Fort Smith became one of the largest and busiest posts in the southwest prior to the Civil War.

The Parade Grounds	35.38912	-94.42944	History	For more than thirty years during the mid-1800s, soldiers drilled on the large parade ground before you. Flanked by the officer's quarters to the right and the enlisted men's barracks on the left, the parade ground was the center of life at the fort. A broad gravel driveway around the grounds encompassed an inner circle and this was the parade ground In the center stood a tall flagstaff, from which dizzy height, Old Glory, flung its protecting folds to the breeze. Morning and evening to the salute of a cannon and the strains of martial music, the flag was raised and lowered.-Mary Rutherford Cravens, recalling life at the second Fort Smith. Gate A When U.S. Army engineers designed the second Fort Smith in 1838, they provided strong fortifications in the form of a large stonewall. Although no military threats to the post ever arose, the wall remained in place until 1897. Today, the location of the wall is outlined by the continuous band of stone behind you. The gateway behind you, Gate A, served as the main gate between the post and the town of Fort Smith.
Deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves	35.38918	-94.42893	History	This statue was erected in 2012 as a result of growing awareness of the extraordinary service of Bass Reeves, an African-American former slave who became a highly respected Deputy U.S. Marshal. The deeds of African-American and Native American lawmen and citizens were often overlooked in standard history accounts for much of the 20th century. A fuller picture of the diversity of the people who contributed to the development of the United States is available at the Fort Smith National Historic Site as well as the various state and tribal sites and museums across the Arkansas River in the former Indian Territory, now the state of Oklahoma.

Bass Reeves - Lawman on the Western Frontier	35.38935	-94.42876	History	Bass Reeves, a slave born in Arkansas and reared in Texas, rose to become one of the best known and effective deputy U.S. marshals to ride out of Fort Smith for Judge Isaac C. Parker. Recognized as one of the first African Americans commissioned as a federal lawman on the western frontier, Reeves was a master of disguise, expert with firearms, and over a thirty year career, arrested thousands of felons, including his son and minister. Newspapers reported that he killed over twenty men in the line of duty. After leaving Fort Smith, Reeves served the federal courts of Paris, Texas and Muskogee in the Indian Territory. Following Oklahoma statehood in 1907, he worked for the Muskogee Police Department until 1909. Reeves died in 1910 at the age of 71 in Muskogee. This statue is a dedication to Bass Reeves and all federal lawmen who bravely served our nation with valor, fortitude, and unwavering integrity. Art T. Burton/Michael Groomer

History of Hebe Statue	35.43430	-94.35541	History	Hebe, Greek goddess of youth and happiness was placed in her fountain on the Crawford County Courthouse lawn in 1908 by the Women's Village Improvement Society. Repairs were made to both Hebe and fountain in memory of Robert Benham who served as county assessor from 1961-1972. The original Hebe was constructed of pot metal then painted gold. Numerous repairs to Hebe and the fountain were made over the first century she reigned on the courthouse lawn. Hebe was beyond repair and the fountain crumbling and inoperable. Women's League of Van Buren, an affiliate of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, spearheaded a campaign to raise funds to restore Hebe and the fountain. Bronze casting of Hebe is compliments of Women's League. Donations from our great community raised funds to rebuild the fountain and establish new landscaping. The original pot metal Hebe will eventually reside in the Crawford County Museum. The steel cap surrounding top of fountain was repaired and is in use today. Dedication of restoration project was held October 12, 2003.

Fairview Cemetery	35.44141	-94.35059	History	The Battle of Prairie Grove was a grim moment for the Confederate Army. This conflict severed all chances for the South to use Northwest Arkansas as a route to invade Missouri. The shattered and defeated soldiers retreated from Prairie Grove to Van Buren. Fairview Cemetery was a witness to wagons and ambulances making their way down the hill as the Confederate Army desperately ran from the Union Soldiers. It was at this same site that cannons were lined up to shell the community of Van Buren. Over 400 unknown Confederate Soldiers are buried in Fairview Cemetery including some who fought and died in this battle. A marble memorial to the brave soldiers who gave their lives in The War Between the States is located in the northeast corner of the cemetery. The Civil War Comes Home

Battlefield Park	35.98322	-94.31008	History	The original 10 acres of Battlefield Park were purchased in 1908 by the Prairie Grove chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and maintained by the U.D.C. for nearly 50 years as a memorial park. From 1886 to 1926 an annual reunion of Confederate veterans was held on this site. The State of Arkansas in 1957 created a Prairie Grove Battlefield Commission which added 55 acres to the Park area and developed the Park as a battle memorial. Members of the first Commission, appointed by Governor Orval E. Faubus, were Fred McCuistion, Mrs. J.C. Parks, Mrs. Lee Seamster, Glenn Will and W.J. Lemke.
Historic Wall	35.98323	-94.30991	History	The circular stone wall that encloses the Battle Monument is built of stones from historic structures of Washington County. Some 40 communities are represented, including the pioneer settlements at Cane Hill, Cincinnati, Viney Grove, Rhea's Mill, Mt. Comfort, Springdale, Elkins, Farmington, Fayetteville, and others. The stones are from early schools and churches, mills, postoffices, colleges, stage-coach stations and pioneer homes. They include building stones from old Cane Hill College, Ozark Institute, Salem Camp Ground, Ada and Sweet Home postoffices, the University of Arkansas, and many others. The wall is truly'History in Stone.'

Rheas Mill	35.98343	-94.31005	History	This tower was the chimney of Rhea's Mill, which stood 6 miles northwest of this spot. The mill was operated by the Federal army before and after the battle of Prairie Grove. General Blunt's supply train was at Rhea's during the battle, under guard of General Frederick Salomon's troops. The tower is 55 feet high and weighs 200,000 pounds. It is 8 feet square at the base and tapers to 4 by 4 feet at the top. It contains 700 stones. The chimney was taken down at Rhea's and reerected here as a memorial to the men who fought on this field December 7, 1862. The tower was given to Battlefield Park in 1957 by Mr. and Mrs. G.C. Mennecke.

March of the Armies	35.98354	-94.31041	History	General Hindman on the Arkansas River planned to drive General Blunt's Federal army out of northwest Arkansas. The Confederate army left Van Buren on December 3. Enroute north, Hindman learned that Blunt had called for help from General Herron at Wilson's Creek, Mo., and that the latter was already on the march. Hindman decided to bypass Blunt at Cane Hill and march to intercept Herron. Herron's army made a forced march of 100 miles in 3 days and ran into the Confederate advance early on the morning of Sunday, December 7. The Confederates established themselves on this ridge, facing northeast. Herron crossed the Illinois River and attacked. Meanwhile Blunt at Cane Hill learned that the Confederate army had bypassed him, so he marched his army to Rhea's Mill, then approached the battle from the northwest, arriving on the field at 2 P.M. Darkness finally halted the bitterly-fought battle. During the night, Hindman's army, low on supplies and ammunition, withdrew south to Van Buren.
Morrow House	35.98359	-94.30955	History	This house, built about 1855, was the home of the John Morrow family, and originally stood on Cove Creek 9 miles south of here. On the night before the battle of Prairie Grove, Confederate General T.C. Hindman met with his division and brigade commanders in this house and made final plans for battle. The army left the Morrow farm for Prairie Grove at 4 o'clock on the morning of December 7, 1862. This house also sheltered General Sterling Price in February 1862 when Price's army was enroute to the battle of Pea Ridge.

29th Arkansas Infantry	35.98498	-94.30601	History	Brothers Columbus and Ad Gray of Company D, 29th Arkansas Infantry, withstood the first Union assault and counterattacked with Sergeant Ad Gray in the lead. Columbus Gray wrote home after seeing his brother fall mortally wounded:'I stopped, squatted down by him, and laid my hand on his head and I said,'Oh my brother whare [sic] are you hurt?' I saw that he was breathing his last...It almost run me distracted. I did not know what to do. I knew I could not do him any good by staying there with him, so I jumped up and run on with the company.'

The Legacy of Prairie Grove/The Borden House	35.98531	-94.30419	History	Prairie Grove was the last major battle in northwest Arkansas and helped seal the fate of Missouri and northern Arkansas. After the Confederate army left, never to return, Union troops and supplies were sent elsewhere. Bushwhackers and jayhawkers then flowed into the region, preying on the civilians left helpless in the power vacuum. The Union army would attempt to root out these lawless brigand bands with varying degrees of success. In the end, the outlaws would reign throughout the Ozarks region until after the Civil War ended in 1865.
Herrons Attack	35.98540	-94.30475	History	From this spot the observer is viewing the fields over which General F.J. Herron's army advanced on the morning of December 7, 1862, to attack the Confederate position on this ridge. Because the ford of the Illinois River was under artillery fire, Herron crossed northwest of the ford, or almost directly north of this spot. His army consisted of troops from Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Arkansas. Herron's divisions bore the brunt of the battle until 2 P.M., when Blunt's army came to his aid. Blunt's army entered the battle one mile west of this spot.

The losses were about 10 per cent of the troops engaged.
Archibald Borden House	35.98542	-94.30445	History	The heaviest casualties were around the Archibald Borden house and orchard. The first house was burned the day after the battle. Mr. Borden built this house on the site of the original in 1872. Charles W. Walker, 34th Arkansas Infantry, recalled:'The once peaceful valley, now a field of carnage was swept with shot, shell, grape, and canister. The shriek of the wounded and the groan of the dying often rose above the din of battle. The Borden Orchard... was the storm center around which the battle raged furiously. Charge after charge across the valley and up the hill on which was Borden's house, was made by the gallant boys in blue, only as often to be repulsed by the boys in gray.'

Blochers Arkansas Battery	35.98543	-94.30464	History	Blocher's Arkansas Battery was the focal point of the Union attacks. A sergeant in the battery reported:'...The enemy advanced upon us with their artillery, under cover of their infantry, until within range of our battery when they opened a most disastrous fire on us from both arms. Hail from Heaven never fell thicker than the shot, shell, and minie balls did for minutes. Having no support, Captain Blocher ordered our men to fall back and save themselves... we discovered our men forming about 200 yards in rear of our battery... Our men then charged and drove them from our guns, with considerable loss to the enemy.'
Lieutenant Colonel John C. Black	35.98603	-94.30540	History	Lieutenant Colonel John C. Black, 37th Illinois Infantry, ordered the retreat of his regiment and the 26th Indiana to a fence at the foot of the ridge. There, the men faced a Confederate counterattack. Captain William P. Black, brother of Lieutenant Colonel Black, wrote his mother about what happened next:'...we had the rebels now just where we had always wanted them, on level clear ground, and we felt now was an hour of vengeance. The regiment rose as one, and poured in a volley...which stopped the rebel pursuit...Our [Colt] revolving rifles kept playing and one and another fell, and one and another fled into the woods whence they came.'

26th Indiana and 37th Illinois Infantry	35.98606	-94.30455	History	The 26th Indiana Infantry and the 37th Illinois Infantry made another attack up the ridge. Colonel John G. Clark, 26th Indiana, U.S.A., wrote:'The regiment was ... ordered on the left of the 37th Illinois...Soon after...they were ordered to charge the enemy, who were strongly posted on a hill covered with timber. My regiment succeeded in reaching...75 yards beyond the crest of the hill, but was overpowered... and driven back in considerable disorder, but rallied...The regiment was...ordered to fall back and take position on the main road, where it remained until the next morning.'
West Battlefield Overlook	35.98652	-94.31667	History	(Panels from Left to Right) (First Panel): At the time of the battle, Nancy Morton lived with her parents in the William Morton house west of this location. When the fighting intensified in the area, the Mortons and three other families scrambled into the root cellar for protection. As Nancy recalled in 1896:'...We all remained in the cellar until dark, but I went into the house several times to get victuals and some bedclothes and wraps for the children. They fought through and around the house, the shots flying like hail in every direction, only a few cannon balls striking close. Mrs. Borden's pony stood hitched close to the cook room, saddled, and was not hurt, and after the firing ceased, she with her three children mounted the pony passed the guards and rode to Mrs. Mock's in safety...' Nancy Morton married Rufus Staples and spent the last years of her life in the Morton House which withstood the onslaught of the battle. (Second Panel): One of the children in the Morton cellar was nine-year-old Caldonia Ann Borden who prepared a memoir in 1937 at the age of 84. Concerning the battle, she remembered:'...We stayed out and watched the battle until two o'clock in the afternoon. The cellar was full of apples, potatoes, and barrels of other foods. I had to sit on a big barrel of vinegar and hold my little sister... After dark it got quiet and we came out of the cellar. There was a dead man across the cellar door, wounded and dying men all around. I can still hear them yelling'help-help-help.' The men worked through the night helping the wounded. Yankees and Rebels all got the same care. Four died that night. One soldier's leg was just hanging by the skin and the doctor cut it off and threw it outside. It sure was scary and pitiful. Some of us got sick.' About twenty men, women, and children huddled in the Morton Cellar for protection from the shells and bullets during the battle. (Third Panel): Map of this sector of the battlefield. Caption: General James G. Blunt's Union Division arrived from the northwest at about 2:30 P.M. and attacked the Confederates on this part of the field until darkness ended the battle. (Fourth Panel): Two cannon shots signaled Blunt's arrival on the battlefield. The Union infantry advanced against the Confederates but were forced back by a rebel counterattack. Captain John W. Rabb, U.S.A., commanding the Second Battery of Indiana Volunteers reported:'...I threw several shell into a straw pile, near the edge of the timber, around which large bodies of the enemy swarmed. The straw was soon ignited, and again we opened with canister for about fifteen minutes. My guns were worked rapidly, making sad havoc in the ranks of the enemy who retreated to the wood. I gave them a few shell as a parting salute, when darkness closed upon us, and we rested upon the field...' (Fifth Panel): General Mosby M. Parsons' Confederates faced the Union attacks here, then counterattacked. He reported:'At this time the enemy made furious assaults upon my lines with a galling fire from three batteries, and a concentration of their musketry on my center with the evident intention of breaking it. This fire was more terrible than any I had experienced during the present war. About this time... the enemy were massing their columns in great force on my extreme left. I immediately ordered my reserve regiment...to advance in that direction... In the meantime... General John S. Roane, having ascertained the critical condition of my left, ordered down Col. John B. Clark's Missouri regiment to support me. This it did in the gallant style characteristic of that officer and his gallant command... The enemy was badly beaten... and the sun was getting low, when seeing the enemy advance...I rode to Colonel Steen and remarked to him that the contest must be closed and that I had determined to charge the enemy with bayonet...' Colonel Alexander Early Steen died leading the last charge of the day.

Four Confederates were seriously wounded and two were captured, along with horses and equipment. The Fourth Arkansas lost one man killed in the skirmish. The combat at Lunenburg illustrates the wars true nature: Most of the men in both forces were residents of Izard County.
Boxley Valley	36.00410	-93.37500	History	When establishing Buffalo National River in 1972, Congress recognized the need to preserve the valley's culture as well as its free-flowing river. Here in Boxley Valley, a traditional farm community is being perpetuated within the borders of Buffalo National River. To do this, the National Park Service and local citizens created a long-term plan to keep the valley privately owned to retain its historic integrity. The community spirit that has endured for more than 150 years is now preserving Boxley Valley for generations to come. Boxley Valley is entered on the National Register of Historic Places, not only for its more-recent cultural heritage but also for the evidence the valley has yielded of 12,000 years of human occupation. Captions: Descendants of the valley's 19th-century settlers still work the land of their forefathers. After the Civil War, frame dwellings began to replace log homes.

A Monarch Returns	36.00480	-93.36790	History	What an exciting discovery to come across an elk roaming the fields and woodlands of the Buffalo River country. Once again these large members of the deer family can be found grazing or resting in clearings and open spaces. Native to the hardwood forests of the Ozarks, an eastern subspecies became extinct by the 1840s. At the prompting of local citizens, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission re-introduced 112 Rocky Mountain elk along the Buffalo River in 1981. Although the elk adapted to their new habitat, parasites, poaching, and road kills have limited their population growth. Nonetheless, these majestic mammals appear to be extending their range in the Buffalo River region. Elk may weigh up to 800 pounds, compared to a 150-pound white-tailed deer. Elk Viewing Tips: Keep your distance. Elk are large, wild animals that can seriously injure you! Use binoculars or telephoto lenses for a better view. Morning and evening are best time for viewing, especially in winter. Use of elk calls or spotlights in the park are prohibited. This exhibit was funded by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, with support from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in cooperation with the National Park Service.

Beaver Jim Villines	36.01890	-93.35740	History	Settling Along the Buffalo Abraham Villines and his children were among the earliest pioneer families in the Buffalo River valley. Abraham's grandson William built this log house in 1850 for his new bride, Rebecca. Four years later their son James was born here. James Villines (1854-1948) was known as Beaver Jim for his renowned trapping ability. After his marriage in 1880, he moved from this home to his own farmstead across the Buffalo River. In the mid-twentieth century, Villines family descendants used this house as a barn---with the chimney still attached. Today, the notched and hand-hewn logs recall the pioneers who carved their homes out of the Buffalo River wilderness. Captions: This cabin was still inhabited in 1914 when two of Beaver Jim's grandchildren posed for this photograph. James'Beaver Jim' Villines, circa 1920s

Urban Renewal planners intended to tear this building down in 1974. The public objected. It was then purchased by Donald E. and Edna Bumpass in 1978. In cooperation with developers Keith Cearley and Ronald E. Bumpass, it was totally restored, renovated, and placed on the National Register of Historical Places. The building has been a focal point for redevelopment of the Fayetteville Square, and its preservation has drawn public attention to the significance of safeguarding the community's cultural heritage and architectural splendor.

Evolution of Fayetteville	36.06241	-94.16012	History	The earliest known inhabitants of the hardwood forest of the Ozarks migrated to Arkansas over 12 thousand years ago through the Great Bering Strait. For the next two thousand years Bluff Dwellers hunted the mountain plateaus before the Quapaws, Cherokee and Osage fished the bountiful lakes and streams and hunted the grassland prairies of the Arkansas highlands. Buffalo herds roamed this area. It was not until 1819 that the first white man saw Fayetteville's hilltop terrain. On March 2, 1819, Congress created the Arkansas Territory. On October 17, 1828, Washington County was established, and Fayetteville was chosen as the capital site. The county commissioners were authorized in 1834 by Congress to sell 160 acres to underwrite the building of a proper Courthouse on this Square. The sale that took from 1835-1837 raised $6340.00 and the courthouse was built in 1837. Several Courthouses graced this site until 1911 when the Old Post Office was constructed. Dedicated to the City of Fayetteville by Dr. Donald E. and Edna Bumpass and Ron E. Bumpass

The name was a hit with the student body, which voted in 1910 to change the official mascot from Cardinals to Razorbacks, giving Arkansas one of the most unique and recognizable mascots in the country.

The Civil War in Lawrence County	36.07986	-91.30511	History	Smithville was the Lawrence County seat in 1861, and while most residents supported secession, others stayed loyal to the Union. At least 17 Confederate companies were raised in the county. Other troops were conscripted into the army later, and slaves and Unionists sought refuge in Federal camps. Civilians faced privation and lawlessness as the war dragged on. Smithville lost its county seat status when Sharp County was carved from Lawrence after the war. Freed people established a post-war village south of Smithville that was called Little Africa.

Isaac Murphy	36.08759	-93.73662	History	Isaac Murphy was born Oct. 16, 1799, in Pennsylvania. A teacher and lawyer, he moved to Fayetteville in 1834 and became involved in politics. Murphy took part in the 1849 Gold Rush, but lost his farm to creditors. He, his wife and daughters moved to Huntsville in 1854. Murphy was elected to the February 1861 convention to consider secession, which declined to leave the Union. It reconvened in April after Ft. Sumter was attacked, and all but five members voted for secession. Four of them changed their votes. Murphy alone stood against disunion.  After the 1861 secession convention, Isaac Murphy returned to Huntsville, receiving many death threats. He fled to the Union army that invaded Arkansas in early 1862, and accompanied the U.S. troops that took Little Rock Sept. 10, 1863. Murphy was named provisional governor in early 1864, and inaugurated to the post April 18, 1864. The staunch Unionist served until 1868, through the early stages of Reconstruction. He lived in Huntsville until his death on Sept. 8, 1882. Gov. Orval Faubus built his house on Murphys home site near here in 1964.
Huntsville Massacre	36.08761	-93.73662	History	On January 10, 1863, nine men, including two Confederate officers and prominent local citizens and Masonic lodge members, were taken from a guardhouse near here, led to Samuel Vaughns farm one mile northeast of Huntsville, and shot. Only one man lived. Lt. Col. Elias Baldwin of the 8th Missouri Cavalry (U.S.) was arrested for murder of prisoners of war, but freed when witnesses failed to appear. The killings may have been motivated by the deaths of 18 Union soldiers escorting Isaac Murphys daughters to their home in Huntsville in November 1862. The nine men killed on January 10, 1863, were Chesley H. Boatright, 39, a blacksmith; Confederate captains Hugh Samuel Berry, 31, and John William Moody, 22; former county treasurer William Berry, 60, a farmer; Watson Stevens, 29, the Berrys cousin; Robert Coleman Young, 56, a minister; and Askin Hughes and John Hughes of Tennessee, who were visiting Huntsville when the incident occurred. The sole survivor of the Huntsville massacre, John Parks, moved to Mississippi after recovering from his wounds. No one was ever punished for the Huntsville slayings.

Brown, Pvt. Henry Fulbright and Pvt. Samuel McCurdy – were buried in Mount Comfort Cemetery. The 34th Arkansas Infantry (C.S.) raised troops at Mount Comfort in 1862 and would fight at Prairie Grove and Jenkins' Ferry. The community held hospitals for Union and Confederate troops and hosted a Unionist colony late in the war, where local farmers banded together for mutual protection from bands of marauders infesting the area.

Wild Haws in the Civil War	36.09067	-91.84064	History	Union troops passed through the Wild Haws area many times during the Civil War. Gen. Samuel Curtis was here with cavalry, artillery and Illinois infantry on May 1, 1862. Fifth Kansas Cavalry troops rode through on July 6, 1862, as did a company of the Eighth Missouri State Militia Cavalry on Dec. 29, 1863. Detachments of the First Nebraska came through Wild Haws on Jan. 23 and Feb. 16, 1864, and the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry was here March 3 and 12. Co. K of the First Nebraska looked for Confederates at Wild Haws on March 10, then camped near town.  Wild Haws, now LaCrosse, was located at a crossroads at the largest cotton plantations in Izard County. In 1861, volunteers of the 7th and 14th (McCarver's) Arkansas Infantry regiments marched through Wild Haws on their way to the Confederate training camp at Smithville. Troopers of Gen. James McBride's 3rd Missouri Cavalry (C.S.) had a skirmish with Union cavalry here in 1862. Confederates rendezvoused near Wild Haws in 1864, and Col. T.R. Freeman's Cavalry rode through here. Gen. Joseph O. Shelby recruited troops in this area that summer.

Wartime Gristmill Destruction	36.13738	-94.17926	History	Both soldiers and civilians used gristmills to grind wheat and corn into flour and meal. Confederate troops destroyed mills to keep Union armies from using them. Union troops destroyed them to keep C.S. guerrillas from using them as gathering points.

Canning Factory	36.25415	-94.13150	History	January 1936, Tom Farish & Joe Steele started building a canning factory using a lot of donated labor. The first run of green beans was June 26, 1936, tomatoes July 22, 1936, followed by spinach and other products later on. After Tom Farish died, in August of 1946, his daughter, Maudine Farish Sanders, managed it for two years before her family sold to Joe Steele. Several years later Steele sold to Allen Canning Company. Operations ceased in mid 1990's when equipment was moved out and the factory torn down, leaving only Allen's warehouse and their water tower. For many years this factory was the main place to work in Lowell. It fed many people either by payroll check or by no label, bent cans, sold to employees at $1.00 per case of 24. A boilerman's 6:00 am whistle meant 7:00 am clock-in. 1-long blast alerted the green bean crew. 2-long blasts called in the spinach crew. Daily USDA runs in the thousands were shipped everywhere. The tower, no longer needed for canning, stands as a silent reminder of its life sustaining past to the City of Lowell. June, 2009

Old City Jail	36.25668	-94.13160	History	Location: West of the railroad tracks on Lincoln Street between McClure & Monroe, almost directly across from Allen Canning Company Warehouse. It was about 12' x 12', made of native stone, cemented together. One small window on the north side was covered with iron bars. One thick wooden door faced east. Inside, on the south wall were two box-like wooden bunks with no mattress. This'no frills' jail built without toilet or lavatory was a poor place to house violators for very long. In the late 1960's, a big hole was dug close by. The jail was pushed in and covered up with dirt. [Image of City Ordinance]

Train Depot	36.25718	-94.13161	History	The St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad was established in 1881. Lowell was a village at that time. The 1889 Goodspeed's History of Benton County says greens, fruits, poultry, timber and railroad ties shipped extensively from the depot. The 1892-93 Springdale News reported Lowell shipped more raspberries than any line from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Monett, Missouri. A favorite event for Lowell teenagers was coming to the depot to see the train go by or who got off. Toby Tucker was the mail messenger for years, meeting the train night and morning. If it needed to stop, he signaled by waving a kerosene lantern, otherwise, a mail crane held the mail pouch track side where the train'snagged it' and kept moving on. Heavy incoming mail pouches were kicked or tossed off, at the precise moment, for Toby to take to the Post Office. In the 1940's, railroad officials put the depot building on a railcar and moved it to another location, possibly in Oklahoma. The boy in the photo on his bicycle is Elza Tucker, his son.

Lowell Postal Service	36.25735	-94.13142	History	The earliest postal area was at Cross Hollows. Records show the Bloomington Post Office was changed to Lowell, March 9, 1881 with Paul F. Lewis, Postmaster. Insets show a 1900 Post Office building on North Jackson Street. The one next door to Green & Henry Store was probably before 1900. Personal knowledge places a post office north of the Lowell Bank in 1929, downstairs in IOOF building in 1949, and later south of that building, where Electric Company is in 2009. The next move was to the north end of the present Fire Department. Lowell's rapid growth soon required a larger building. It moved two doors west of the railroad crossing on Monroe Street. Yet, another growth spurt pushed it further south on Lincoln Street where it is in 2009. Some early postmasters were: Edwin J. Bishop, 1907 Jesse Mabry, 1910 Hugh McClure, 1913 Nina B. Cowan, 1919 Again as Nina B. Neil Perry V. Johnson, 1920 James H. Smith, 1928 Myrtle Nail, 1934 Tolbert H. Graham, 1936 Arthur Mayes, 1942 Canda Smith, 1943 Marjorie Collier, 1948 and Elza R. Tucker, July 1, 1949. W. H. Cowan was the rural carrier in the 1920's. Sam Cupps was Route No. 1 carrier in the 1930's. Elza Tucker was rural carrier for many years and retired after 31 years of service. Now there are 6 routes out of Lowell.
Evaporator Near Railroad Track	36.25740	-94.13177	History	This evaporator dried apples over wooden racks with wood fired furnace heat. After drying, the peeled, sliced apples were sprinkled with powdered sulphur as a preservative. They were shipped out in big barrels by railroad cars. This work was nearly all done by hand. There was a sandbox out front for children to play in while their mothers worked. Elza Tucker, age 90 in 2009, remembers playing in the sandbox as a young child. It was operated by J. W. Kimmons at that time.

The Bank of Lowell	36.25744	-94.13146	History	Humphrey Barr, brother of Mrs. L. P. Davis, was an early banker. We know Henry Neal was the banker in 1918. He loaned Elza Tucker's mother $75 to buy a family sewing machine. He charged 10 percent interest and had a loan limit of $100. Elza has the receipt dated the same year he was born. Bank transactions moved at a steady but cautious pace for several years. That pace changed quickly in 1929 when the bank was robbed. Jude Austin tells, in his'Lowell Memories,' how he was locked in the vault. That vault is still in place in 2009. Tin wall and ceiling tiles are still intact inside the upper part of the building, too. The original safe was moved and used at the First National Bank of Rogers under George Mills for a time, then brought back home. Although it was given to the museum, the city of Lowell has both moved and stored it many years. It is simply too heavy for the museum floor. After the 1930's depression, the building housed stores run by Harrison Smith, Loyd Mabry, Orville & Edith Neal, Leon Chadwick, and perhaps others, but never again a bank. It was the first home of the Lowell Museum in 1976. (A full account of the bank hold-up is available on dvd at the museum)

Mudtown	36.25786	-94.13200	History	The Old Wire Road at Mudtown was used by the Butterfield Overland Mail Co. and both Union and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. In February 1862, Union troops ate food left behind at a Confederate camp and were sickened. Some died, leading to charges that the abandoned supplies were poisoned. Three companies of the 1st Arkansas Cavalry (U.S.) were in a skirmish here Dec. 9, 1862, suffering 1 hurt and 4 missing. Guerrillas attacked a Union wagon train here on Aug. 24, 1864, killing at least one man. The spring here provided water for Mudtown.

Capture of Missouri Swamp Fox	36.26126	-90.96970	History	Pocahontas was a no-man's land after the Confederate troops organized here in 1861 moved east of the Mississippi. Soldiers and irregulars from both sides patrolled the region. One group of 300 Union militia and cavalry from Arkansas and Missouri came here on Aug. 22, 1863, after learning that Brig. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson was staying at the St. Charles Hotel. Thompson, known as the Swamp Fox for his many victories in the swampy region, was taken by surprise. Exchanged in 1864, he commanded troops in northeast Arkansas, surrendering May 11, 1865.

Old Carrollton	36.26253	-93.32167	History	Settled 1833, was on the much-traveled Carrollton-Forsyth-Springfield road during the Civil War. A training center for Southern troops, it was important in movement of troops and supplies. Guerrilla warfare ravaged the area. Skirmishes occurred January 1863, March and August 1864. Every building except two stables was destroyed. Herrons army camped here in January 1863, after the Battle of Prairie Grove (Dec. 7, 1863). As county seat (1834-1875) it was an important trading and political center. Seventeen children, survivors of Mountain Meadows Massacre (Utah, 1857) were returned here.

War Eagle Mill	36.26716	-93.94313	History	In 1832, Sylvanus Blackburn left Tennessee with a wagon and four oxen, and came to the War Eagle River valley in Arkansas. He spent the winter building a log home and clearing the land of his homestead. He brought his wife from Tennessee the next year. One of Sylvanus' first projects was a water-powered grist mill. In 1838, a flood on War Eagle destroyed the mill. A second mill, four stories tall, was soon erected. Five of Blackburn's sons joined the Confederate Army and the rest of the family went to Texas. The retreating Confederate Army burned the mill on War Eagle to prevent its use by Federal troops. Sylvanus' sixth son, James Austin Cameron Blackburn, built the third mill in 1873. The village of War Eagle grew around the grist mill. There was a sawmill, carpentry shop, and a blacksmith shop, but the grist mill was the center of activities -- socializing, square dancing, and weddings. In 1924, once again the mill burned. For nearly 50 years only the dam and raceway remained. In 1973, centennial year of the original mill, Jewell A., Leta Medlin and Zoe Medlin Caywood built the existing fourth mill on the same foundation as an authentic reproduction of the first mill to preserve the history of grist milling.

War Eagle Mills	36.26778	-93.94397	History	Sylvanus Blackburn came to the War Eagle in 1832. By 1838 he had a saw mill, a grist mill, and a house. Peter Van Winkle came about 1850. By 1860, this was a thriving crossroads. March 8, 1862, Generals Van Dorn and Price, retreating from the battlefield, bivouacked 10 miles south of Elkhorn. The next day they reached the Blackburn - Van Winkle area where abandoned homes housed the sick and exhausted. While Curtis was in camp at Cross Hollows before the battle Col. Grenville M. Dodge ground corn in Blackburn's mill.

Camping 10 miles from the ferry, they learned that 3,000 Confederate infantry and cavalry with four cannon were approaching. Wilbers troops seized horses, wagons and other supplies and prepared to head to Missouri with the loot.  As the Missouri Unionists moved north, Col. J.R.

The charge was made with such impetuosity and gallantry that they fought their way through to the main force without losing a man, though Mooney was severely wounded. Major Wilber claimed the Confederates lost 10 men as casualties and 25 as prisoners.

Eureka Springs Historical Museum	36.39933	-93.74094	History	This three-story limestone building with metal-clad roof enclosing the top story was constructed in 1889 by Samuel L. Calif. For fifty years it served as a residence, general merchandise store, and boarding house. About 1948 the building was converted for use as a meeting hall for the B.P.O.E., and was known as the Elks Lodge until 1970 when the organization relocated. Since 1947 the original Ozark Folk Festival is held annually in Eureka Springs, directed by a non-profit corporation of local citizens. In 1971 the festival board of directors purchased the Calif House for the purpose of establishing a museum of local history, a museum advisory board accepted the task to collect, preserve and exhibit artifacts in the building, and the museum opened to the public October, 1971. In 1980 the festival board created Eureka Springs Historical Museum, Inc., an association open to membership by all interested persons which assumed ownership of the museum property and oversight of its operation. The wood and glass store front and two-story ornamented wood porches were replaced as the building was restored to its original appearance. Calif Spring Located adjacent to the museum building is Calif Spring situated in a spring reservation established by the City of Eureka Springs February 15, 1886 and maintained as a public park. Originally named Table Rock Spring, the name Calif came into common use after that family built their residence next to it. Cora Pinkley Call Cabin and Heritage Garden The log cabin and garden were established as a museum property beginning in 1997 in an effort to preserve the pioneer history of the vicinity. The cabin was constructed in 1930 using hand-hewn logs from the James Seaton cabin built at Blue Spring about 1830 as well as logs from other surviving pioneer cabins in the vicinity. Door and hearth stone are from G. W. Pinkley homestead of 1865 date. Cora Pinkley Call, noted Ozark folklorist and author, used the cabin as a studio and organized the Ozark Writers and Artists Guild there about 1933.

Calif Spring	36.39948	-93.74089	History	Calif Spring was originally called Table Rock Spring, named for the rock formation above the spring area. This area was set aside as a spring reservation in 1886 by City Ordinance. S. L. Calif established a residence and general store next to the spring, which he excavated and cleaned. He was given a 99 year lease on the land where his house was located. It was then referred to as'Calif Spring.' The odd round stone building in this park covers Calif Springs itself. It was built following a study done in 1921 by a national engineering firm which resulted in the development of a major water treatment program for the springs. The water was subjected to the ultra-violet rays of a mercury lamp enclosed in a quartz tube and operated by direct electric current. This treatment was used on five springs on Main and Spring Streets. Construction cost for Calif Spring was estimated at $260. Cost for electricity to operate all the systems was estimated at $600 per year - high for the 1920s. To pay for the project an ordinance was passed to create a Spring Improvement District and impose a tax assessment on each property in this District. Spring Reservations Eureka Springs was founded upon the belief that there was healing for human ills to be found in the waters which flowed from the springs in the bluffs. From the earliest days, city government realized the need to protect and preserve these precious spring waters for the benefit of all. Thus, large tracts of open land on the hillsides around and above the springs were established by law as Spring Reservations. Most of these spring reservations are still in place. How These Springs Work Eureka Springs has a karst geology which produces two distinct groundwater systems. The first unit is composed of the Boone Foundation which is a highly fractured limestone. It is extremely porous and up to 250' thick. Beneath this is a two-unit layer of St. Joe Limestone. The top unit is finely crystalline limestone which forms bluffs and when fractured, forms caves. It is 30-45' thick. The second unit is less resistant and forms slopes rather than bluffs. It is 12-24' thick. Beneath these is a thin layer of Chattanooga Shale less than 1-10' thick. The shale creates an impermeable divider between the groundwater systems. Water flowing through the upper system cannot pass through the Chattanooga Shale, so it surfaces through the St. Joe limestone. The areas' valleys parallel the contour lines of the Chattanooga Shale, spreading the underground flow into many small springs. Beneath the Chattanooga Shale are three more layers of rock. Sylamore Sandstone, 2-25' thick, Powell Formation, 20' thick and Cotter Formation, 150' thick. Water from these lower layers only appear where the Chattanooga Shale has been removed by erosion such as in Dairy Hollow and Leatherwood Creek. More recent groundwater tracing has led to the discovery that the springs of Eureka Springs get their water from local sources - the areas where most residents live - not thousands of miles away. [Photo and diagram drawing captions on left read] - Of the five springs, only Calif Spring still retains its stone treatment building. - Springs Systems of Eureka Springs Why You Can't Drink From The Springs Now The important aspect of these water systems is that the springs are recharged by rainfall. They have a rapid response to heavy rainfall indicating that the groundwater systems are composed of channels. There is little soil contact which limits natural filtration. Thus, settlement around the spring recharge areas is the reason the spring water is no longer drinkable. The ever shifting karst terrain causes the water and sewer pipes to fracture. Their contents then leak into the groundwater system channels and come out in the springs. Even though the water in the spring still looks clean and pure, it is contaminated.

Bank of Eureka Springs	36.40016	-93.74004	History	Bank of Eureka Springs was established in May, 1912, in the Klock and Clark Building at 75 Spring Street. In 1946 it was relocated to 40 Spring Street. In 1966, the bank purchased the McGinnis property at 70 South Main Street. The old livery barn and store building were torn down. A spacious brick building was constructed and opened for business November 25, 1967, with the first free parking, drive-up window and community room of any bank in the county. The George M. McGinnis and Son Livery Stable was established in the 1890's, just one of many stables and blacksmith shops along South Main Street. Otis McGinnis carried on the livery business until about 1930 when automobiles had replaced horses for transportation, then operated the feed store until advanced old age. His heirs sold the property to the Bank of Eureka Springs in 1966. In 1978 the bank building was enlarged and remodeled by local contractor, Wayne Johnson. The building was to be made in the style of earlier Eureka Springs' bank architecture, using brick and limestone quarried near Elk Ranch, the same quarry which supplied the stone to build much of historic Eureka Springs. The interior was also of late 19th century Eureka Springs' bank architecture and fixtures. The dedication was held June 23, 1979, as one of the key events of the Eureka Springs centennial. By December, 1993, further enlargement of the facility was needed and the board determined to build a two-story addition at the south end of the structure. The theme of Victorian architecture was continued inside and out. Tom Crews Johnson of Eureka Springs was the architect. Herman Pinkley, local contractor, carried out construction completed in 1995.

Bank of Eureka Springs Community Room	36.40055	-93.73963	History	Ellis Murphy established Murphy's Firestone Tire Service at this site about 1923. Called'Murphy the Tire Man', his services were frequently required to patch inner tubes and repair tires for hundred[s] of automobiles bringing tourists to Eureka Springs. The limestone building was an auto repair shop until July 1973 when it was purchased for use as a community room for the Bank of Eureka Springs. They brought back and placed the first old-time awning on the building, beginning a restoration trend which spread throughout the historic district, and the building was restored in time for the 1979 Eureka Springs Centennial.

Laundry Spring	36.40078	-93.73410	History	The site of this spring was outside the area included in the 1879 survey. Known as East Mountain, this area was crowded with wood structures by 1885. The spring, which flowed from a small cave lined with projections of onyx stone, was already recognized for the healing waters. Water made a stream down over the rock ledges to the creek below. The overflow of Little Eureka Springs, Cave Springs and others joined this stream further up the ravine. The spring overflow was very accessible and townspeople soon began to collect the water from below for household use. A wash house or laundry was established below the spring. In an early census, many women listed their occupation as a laundress. The town's first government quickly passed an ordinance to protect all the springs. Circa 1880, Ordinance No. 10, Section 2: All persons washing their persons or clothes in or above the basins of all public springs shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The Riley survey of 1893 delineates the boundaries of a spring reservation. On August 4, 1903, an ordinance was enacted creating and describing Laundry Springs Reservation. The spring was known, however, from that date as Onyx Spring. All the onyx stone is reputed to have been taken for souvenirs over time. In 1922, residents of East Mountain raised all the funds needed to employ carpenters Dillow and Bingham to make improvements around the spring. They built a wood shelter over the cave opening. It was proudly boasted'not a penny came from the city for these improvements.' The Parks and Recreation Commission officially recognized the spring as Laundry Spring on October 8, 2003.
The Western District Courthouse	36.40085	-93.73879	History	Eureka Springs was incorporated on Valentine's Day in 1880. At that time, the only courthouse was in the county seat of Berryville, some 12 miles to the east. This was a great distance at the time, the roads were bad, and the King's River had to be forded if it was passable. As a result, the citizens of Eureka Springs petitioned for their own courthouse, and in 1883, the Arkansas General Assembly enacted legislation to create the Western Judicial District of Carroll County. In 1906 Claude A. Fuller was elected mayor of Eureka Springs. A rented room was being used as a courthouse and the town wanted a new one. The problem was to get the Quorum Court, composed of all the Justices of the Peace in the county, to approve an appropriation for the purpose of building the courthouse. The night before the matter of the appropriation was to come before the Court, Mayor Fuller discovered that two Justices of the Peace from the Western District of the county were absent, and he needed their votes. He telephoned the Chief of Police in Eureka Springs and instructed him to go out on horseback, leading two horses for the justices to use, and bring the absent ones in. The following morning at 5:00, the Chief of Police and the two reluctant justices rode into Berryville. When the Court met and the matter was put to vote, those two justices made it a tie. Tom Fancher, the County Judge broke the tie by voting for the appropriation, and that is how Eureka Springs obtained its courthouse. It was designed and constructed of native limestone by W.O. Perkins and Son in 1908.

The Civic Center	36.40096	-93.73861	History	These two large limestone public buildings anchor this part of downtown Eureka Springs. They span the deep ravine cut by Leatherwood Creek which flows in a tunnel beneath all the buildings on this entire part of Main Street. [Photo 1.] This view shows South Main Street toward Basin Park in the 1890s before the Auditorium was built. The large Southern Hotel is shown in the center. This very early lodging survived all the great fires in the 1880s and 1890s which destroyed most of the town's early wooden buildings. It had grown to over 100 rooms when it too burned in 1933. [Photo 2.] Carroll County Western District Courthouse is viewed here shortly after construction in 1908. Note the deep ravine on both sides. When the ravine was filled for parking, a'moat' was left around the lower level. A bronze plaque in front tells the Courthouse story. [Photo 3.] The whole town turned out for the Auditorium Groundbreaking Ceremony on April 11, 1928. This view is toward the north from the Courthouse. The Auditorium was opened by the John Philip Sousa Orchestra on September 13, 1929. It offered a spacious theater and a basement gymnasium which served local schools until the 1960s. It was renovated in 2005 with a matching U.S. Department of the Interior Save America's Treasures grant. In The Neighborhood Rock House Cave: Across from The Auditorium is a wooden stairway which is actually Rock House Avenue, a city street. Up the stairs, behind the building is Rock House Cave, viewed only from the stairway. It was said to be a hospital during the Civil War where injured soldiers were treated with water from Basin Spring. In early rough days of Eureka Springs, it was the popular Rock House Saloon.

Civil War Healing	36.40129	-93.73818	History	The Eureka Springs areas reputation as a health resort has its origins in the Civil War. Late 19th-century accounts claim Dr. Alvah Jackson treated sick and wounded soldiers during the war. In early 1865, Maj. J.W. Cooper, who led Confederate troops in the Indian Territory, came to Carroll Co. with four comrades seeking Jacksons aid to recover from the effects of hard service. They holed up in the rock house near the areas abundant springs and recuperated. Cooper and his companions returned for a reunion with Jackson at the springs in 1880.

Chandler Mall Buildings	36.40139	-93.73783	History	Richard H. James and Charles S. Beck built the three story brick and limestone Beck and James Building in the year 1888 to house a clothing and apparel store. F. H. and Avarilla James and their family resided in the upper rooms and C. S. Beck was a boarder in their household. He was a practitioner of the art of magnetic healing. Zadock P. Freeman, well known civic leader and mayor, built the Freeman Block, another brick and limestone structure, in which F.A. Pickard operated a hardware and furniture store. The substantial three story buildings were constricted two years before the level of Main Street was raised and widened with the result that their lower floors were enclosed by high stone retaining walls. About five years earlier, R. H. James constructed a large wooden building with a fine hardwood floor beside Main Street adjacent to the future site of the Beck and James Building. He operated a skating rink where visitors skated on wheels to music. Roller skating was one of the most popular year round sports in America in the Victorian Era. This building was damaged or destroyed by the Great Fire of 1888 and James rebuilt a portion of it as an opera house. Theatrical stock companies and road shows then touring the country gave performances throughout the year in the beautifully appointed theater. It was originally lighted with coal gas lamps, and replaced in 1899 with 200 electric lights and footlights for the stage. Local recitals, musicales, and political rallies were held at the opera house as well. Changing times brought new interests. In 1917 Mary Arnheiter, Mary Lou Evans and Alma H. J. Hubbell adapted the opera house to show motion pictures and opened'The Queens Photoplay House'. In 1923 the building was used as the Pentecostal Mission meeting house. By the Great Depression in the 1930's many large wood buildings were no longer in use and owners found that there was a market for salvaged lumber in surrounding communities. It is believed the opera house was among buildings razed in that era. The site is now a parking lot. In 1930, Edgar J. Chandler operated a grocery store in the Beck and James Building and his wife, Ida, sold ladies ready-to-wear in the Freeman Block. In 1952, the Clark brothers, Norman and Roland, established the town's first modern supermarket on the premises. In 1977, an entire block of buildings from the Basin Bath House to the Auditorium were sold to John Fuller Cross by the current supermarket owners. Thus began a massive restoration project of these buildings which included removal of a false front and aluminum veneer. Restoration was completed in time for the 1979 Eureka Springs Centennial.
Mud Street andUnderground Eureka	36.40139	-93.73783	History	Professor KALKLOSCH's Guidebook, published in 1880, states: The first street of the town was surveyed down the gulch below the spring. A broad avenue connects this street with the famous EUREKA BASIN SPRING. It being the first street it was named MAIN STREET. Owing to its low elevation and the law of gravitation, water would find a level in the street and as immense travel created an abundance of mud, the street was nicknamed MUD, a name without music or elegance. Dozens of wooden structures lined MAIN STREET along a small creek which collected runoff from the springs. Great fires in 1883 and 1888 destroyed most of the early buildings. Owners rapidly rebuilt more substantial commercial blocks of limestone and brick but set at the same level along the creek and narrow street. In 1890 major street improvements were undertaken. Limestone walls were built, filled in and smoothed to provide a wider surface for MAIN and SPRING STREETS, often raising the new throughfares up to the second story level in front of many fine business houses whose ground floor doors and windows then faced the new retaining walls a few feet away. Thus, a series of buildings along MAIN and the downhill side of SPRING STREET turned ground floors into basements, connected by narrow passageways that once were storefronts. Most MAIN STREET buildings also have yet another basement level through which runs the little stream of water.

The Southern Hotel	36.40183	-93.73765	History	The Southern was built in the year 1880 adjacent to Basin Spring and some 25 feet above it on the hillside. L.M. Rainey of Missouri, its original owner, sold the hotel to W. E. Beatty in 1886, at which time it was acclaimed to be one of the city's two finest hotels, the other being Perry House, situated on the opposite side of the spring. Damaged in the Great Fire of 1890, The Southern was repaired and enlarged to one hundred rooms, gas lighted throughout, and boasting for a time an outdoor'elevator' which lifted guests from Basin Spring level to hotel entrance. Wallace McQuerry owned the hotel in 1932 and had renamed it Southern Home. On November 12 that year this handsome wooden structure which stood for just over half a century was destroyed in what the Times-Echo and other newspapers described as'a spectacular blaze.'

If there is any one in the city you desire to find, if no other way, go to the Basin Springs, seat yourself comfortable, and await his coming.' Prof. L.J. Kalklosch, The Healing Fountain, 1881. [Inset photo captions read] The earliest visitors to this place in the wilderness that would become Eureka Springs were here in desperate need of better health. Long known as a healing spring by Native Americans, the water was thought to cure all kinds of illness. Health-seekers flocked here in 1879, arriving on foot, horseback and in wagons. These were mostly poor people who had exhausted all other remedies. They lived in covered wagons, tents and rough shacks. Days were spent sociably walking from spring to spring with tin cups and water bottles to drink from each. By the 1890s Eureka Springs was becoming a fine spa resort. Basin Park had fine hotels on either side. The Southern Hotel on the south and The Perry House on the north. After The Perry House burned it was replaced with the Basin Park Hotel in 1905, the last of the big hotels. Since the 1880s, one of the landmarks of Spring Street has been the Flatiron Building. This is the fourth one to stand in this spot. Note the fine new brick buildings in this 1890s photograph. The original wooden structures were destroyed in a series of Great Fires. In The Neighborhood Rock House Cave: South of the park is a wooden stairway which is actually Rock House Avenue, a city street. Up the stairs, behind the building is Rock House Cave, viewed only from the stairway. Bluff Shelter: The Bluff Shelter and the outlet for Basin Springs are on the hillside above the park. The 1905 Basin Park Hotel: The hotel was noted by Ripley's Believe It or Not as a seven story hotel with a ground floor entrance on each level. Several of these entrances can be seen from the gazebo. Balm of Life Sign: The arch sign is a replica of an early sign placed over the spring near the current site of the Bandshell. It was a gift to Eureka Springs from the local Rotary Club on the 125th anniversary of the city in 2004.

The Stone Walls	36.40224	-93.73745	History	Eureka Springs claims an estimated fifty-six miles of stone walls. Skilled stonemasons constructed most of the walls between 1885 and 1910. The limestone used was sometimes quarried on site but the majority was transported to the town site by horse drawn wagons or railroad flatcars from the quarry near Beaver, six miles away and the railroad junction 2 miles north of Eureka Springs. In the first census of Eureka Springs in 1880, thirty men gave'stonemason' as their occupation. They were drawn to the new town where construction of dwellings and commercial buildings went on all day and far into the night to keep up with demand. Stonemasons built mainly foundations and retaining walls for the early wood structures. Major fires in 1883 and 1888 brought about a change to stone and brick construction to safeguard against fire. In 1890, a project to improve and widen the town's main streets and beautify its public places resulted in building many miles of stone walls. This was a massive project as stonemasons constructed walls as much as twenty feet high along Spring, Howell and Main, the Boulevard and other streets. Walls were built on either side of the stream flowing down Main Street and connected by arched stone bridges. The best known wall builders in Eureka Springs during its first half century were James M. Waldrip and his sons, William, James and John. The Waldrip brothers built miles of walls and created finely crafted stonework to enhance several spring reservations under the directions of the Board of Public Affairs. Sam A. Leath, Chamber of Commerce Director, devised the estimate of 56 miles of walls about 1948 as a new era of tourism began. Ripley's'Believe It or Not' features in newspapers, radio and television, illustrated the oddities of Eureka Springs more times than any other city, including'136 winding, twisting streets' and'rock walls... miles and miles of them.' Since the 1970 designation of Eureka Springs as a National Register Historic District, more miles of walls have been built in restoration and preservation efforts. Stonemasons as skilled as those who first arrived in Eureka Springs in 1880 continue to create stone walls of great beauty and lasting quality.

The Perry House - Basin Park Hotel	36.40229	-93.73719	History	1884 - Cutter's Guide The Eureka Springs of Arkansas The hotels and boarding houses of Eureka Springs are numerous. The Perry House is the only real first-class hotel in the city and we say this with no disparagement of the Southern, Hancock, Harper or other houses that would be the first-class houses but for the Perry House. The Perry House 1881-1890 This first-class hotel was built around two-years ago, by Mr. Joseph Perry, of Colorado, a gentleman who has built more good hotels on the line of the railroads in Kansas City and Colorado. Mr. Perry came to Eureka Springs as an invalid and considered incurable, but he was so quickly and perfectly cured of his sufferings that he felt grateful enough to build a fine hotel. He has not only built a fine house, but [h]as furnished it throughout in the best manner, and keeps it in first-class style in every particular. The 1905 Basin Park Hotel - A Hotel For A Day Or A Year The Basin Park Hotel ranks among the largest and most modern resort hotels in the country, a fire-proof structure, built at a cost of $150,000. The hotel occupies a central position at the resort, adjoining the famous Basin Spring. From every floor bridges reach to the mountain, conveniently leading to pleasant walks, also affording guests a feeling of great security in case of fire. The Basin Park is equipped with all modern conveniences, including fine electric elevator with every known safety appliance, electric lights, hot and cold water in every room, one hundred bed-rooms, fifty with private bath, telephone in each guestrooom and guest's bath-room on every floor. The dining-room will seat two hundred persons. Lobby, office, barber-shop and drugstore on the ground floor. The seventh floor is devoted to ball-room, sun parlor, reception, grill and billiards room. -1907 hotel brochure. A Hotel For The 21st Century Marty and Elize Roenick purchased the Basin Park Hotel on February 28, 1997 with plans of construction of a semi-retirement home on the hotel top floors. Although the loft style home was never built, the Roenicks have been responsible for the preservation and restoration of the Basin Park and Crescent Hotels, doing their part in protecting the irreplaceable. -2002 gubernatorial proclamation This property has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior

The Three Flat-Irons	36.40244	-93.73700	History	The original Flat-Iron Building was constructed within sight of Basin Springs in the year 1880. It housed the town's first banking establishment and was the first structure made of brick among hundreds of wood buildings. The unusual three-sided, four story structure featured wood trim and a wraparound porch between second and third floors. In 1890 a fire began in the nearby Perry House Hotel which destroyed several buildings, including the Flat-iron. A second Flat-Iron was constructed on the site within a short time. The three-story building was made of brick with elaborate limestone ornamentation and a pressed metal cornice. In 1900 the building housed the Frisco Saloon with business offices and a lodge hall on upper floors. In 1925 the second Flat-Iron succumbed to fire. The brick and stone remains were taken down and the site stood vacant until 1989 when the third Flat-iron was constructed, incorporating architectural design elements of both previous structures

Mud Street to Main Street	36.40265	-93.73591	History	It being the first street in town... it was named Main Street. But owing to its low elevation and the law of gravitation, the water would find a level in the street, and as the immense travel created an abundance of mud, the street was nicknamed'Mud Street' a name without music or elegance.' L.J. Kalklosch, The Healing Fountain, 1880 This long view shows North Main Street before the Great Fires when all the buildings were made of wood. Note the openness under the Grand Central Hotel which spanned the creek. In early days, this hotel was [used] as a stagecoach stop. Groceries were sold on the ground floor with lodging above. The wooden hotel burned in 1892 and was rebuilt in brick, billing itself as'the only brick fireproof hotel in the city with Onxy Spring water on each floor.' Right next to the Grand Central Hotel, Walker Brothers Department Store was a popular shopping place right up until the 1980s. The deep ravine next to it was covered with a large platform and used for special sales, rallies and other popular events. This block is still intact from the early days when it was a hub for everyday needs. Messersmith's Grocery and Produce was on the corner with a barber shop next door. The block was anchored on the other end by Bergdorf's Grocers in a fine brick and stone building. This later became a center for the revival of pride in Ozark heritage led by sisters Edna Pike Bergdorf and Zoe Pike Harp and their husbands. It is currently the Main Stage Creative Community Center In The Neighborhood Leatherwood Creek Tunnels: Main Street's most prominent water feature is Leatherwood Creek, a tributary of the White River which now flows both openly and under Main Street in a long tunnel - one aspect of the mysterious Eureka Springs Underground. From Jackson Street to the east, you can get a good sense [of] the creek. Jacob's Ladder: Behind the Jackson Street overview of Leatherwood Creek is a long stairway leading up to many of the spring reservation parks on East Mountain. Tibbs Alley: On the west side of Main Street is another stairway/street leading up to Center Street near Basin Spring Park. Hatchet Hall: The last home of fiery leader of the temperance movement, Carry A. Nation. This boarding house is located up the hill on Steel[e] Street reached by Jacob's Ladder (turn right at the top) or Flint Street. She operated the lodging here for several years before she collapsed after giving her final oration in Basin Spring Park in 1911. The deteriorating home was rescued by noted artists Elsa and Louis Freund in the 1930s, turned into a studio, school and gallery which formed the core of an arts community which still thrives today in Eureka Springs.

Law Offices of F. O. Butt	36.40271	-93.73704	History	Festus Orestes Butt was born in 1875 in Illinois just before his family moved to Carroll County, Arkansas. He became a licensed attorney before he was of legal age. The Arkansas General Assembly set aside his'disability of minority', and he set up a practice in Eureka Springs in 1894. Elected to the legislature, Butt served four years, then two successive terms in the state senate before 1910. He was elected mayor of Eureka Springs in 1911, 1916 and 1920. During a second term in the Assembly, Butt enacted special legislation in 1913 that gave Eureka Springs perpetual first class city status, regardless of population. Beloved for his oratory, wisdom and service to community, F. O. Butt practiced his profession on these premises until his death in 1972.

Fire and Brick & Stone	36.40441	-93.73854	History	The neighborhood above the current First Baptist Church burned in the Great Fire of 1883, the first of four Great Fires which destroyed most of the town's early wooden structures. New commercial buildings were built of more fire-resistant materials such as brick and limestone. This block, originally called Rice Avenue, is one of the most interesting downtown. Beautiful spring parks anchor both corners. [Inset photo captions read] [1.] The Wadsworth Building was the first structure to rise from the ashes after the second Great Fire in 1888. This multi-story building was a popular home furnishings and hardward store whose ghost signs still give hint to the wide variety of merchandise offered by various owners. This view also shows the foundations of the'new' U.S. Post Office, completed in 1918. [2.] Originally the site of the Kentucky House, the Sharp's Continental Oil Filling Station was located here in 1928 to provide convenient service to the automobile tourist. It was enlarged and converted to law offices in 1964. [3]. The Sweet Spring Hotel once stood here. It was built in 1887 and later became the Huntington Hospital. It burned in the 1940s and site was vacant until the current building was constructed to blend well into the corner in 1994. The unique Palace Bath House sign is said to be the first neon sign west of the Mississippi River, designed by colorful local sign artist By Golly.

Sweet Spring Hotel - Huntington Infirmary - Sweet Spring Home	36.40445	-93.73849	History	Sweet Spring Hotel The Sweet Spring Hotel was established about 1887 at the corner of Pine Street and Spring, then known as Rice Street, with A.S. Capps as proprietor. The spacious three-story frame structure was painted white with dark trim color accenting the simple decorative details of multiple large windows and verandahs. The glass-enclosed dining room and parlor conservatory for guests occupied a two-story wing. The hotel was situated adjacent to the Sweet Spring and publicized its central location. A directory of 1900 date claimed'table service best of the market, electric cars at the door, rates $1 per day'. T.J. Brumfield succeeded Capps as proprietor until 1913 when Robert H. Huntington, a medical specialist from Mississippi and son-in-law of Festus Orestes (F.O.) Butt, long-time Eureka Springs attorney (from 1897-1971), acquired the building. The doctor equipped the building with the latest innovations for treatment of patients, including an operating room, and established Huntington Infirmary, the city's first modern hospital. Huntington Infirmary The hospital was fitted with the latest modern equipment and the building provided a light and well-ventilated environment for convalescents. Several local doctors made use of the facility including Pace, Bolton, Albert and Pearl Tatman and J.F. John. Dr. Huntington closed the infirmary in 1929 as it was no long self-sustaining financially. That same year a community-wide effort resulted in the opening of the Don Sawyer Hospital, forerunner of the present facility. The compassionate purpose of Huntington Infirmary was best symbolized by two carved stone figures which flanked the stair steps at the entry beside Spring Street: a lion and a lamb lying side by side, symbols of a peaceable kingdom where suffering and want could no longer be found. Sweet Spring Home New owner, Mrs. Arch Kimberling, reopened the structure as a residential hotel in 1930. The building fell victim to fire in the early 1940's and the site remained vacant for more than half a century, until the existing building was constructed in 1994 by Charles and Janet Epley to house Carroll County Abstract & Title Co.
Sweet Spring	36.40459	-93.73810	History	This spring derived its name from early townspeople who declared the water to have a pleasant, sweet taste. The spring was originally located in the deep ravine below the present site. A long wooden stairway led from the spring to the narrow wagon road then known as Rice Street, which is now called Spring Street. Sweet Spring was also referred to as Spout Spring. Around 1885 workmen dug into the mountainside above the street to locate the stream of water in a more accessible location. A stone lined circular enclosure around the spring, and finely pointed limestone walls were constructed against the hillside. The Waldrip brothers, William, James and John, were the skilled stonemasons who performed this work. When Spring Street was widened, a small public area adjacent to the spring was set aside. Wide boardwalks and wood benches were built. A long wooden stairway led to a pathway and a street above the spring. In 1916 the Waldrip brothers built a stone stairway inset with benches to replace the old wood steps. The Eureka Springs Women's Club funded these improvements, along with many other community beautification projects. A.O. Clark, who later designed the auditorium in 1928, was the architect for this project. Sweet Spring and the wooded area above and below it were established by Ordinance No. 77 dated February 15, 1886 as a spring reservation, preserved for public use in perpetuity.

Eastview Cottage	36.40522	-93.73738	History	Eastview is situated adjacent to Harding Spring on a lot originally registered by Absalom M. Thomas after the town site survey of 1879. John E. and Bell Perrin purchased the lot and residence in October, 1881, then sold to David R. and Harriett N. Whitcomb who also owned the adjacent house named Whitcomb Cottage. Eastview was next sold to Royal F. and A. E. Elliott whose heirs sold it to Robert C. Ramey in August, 1919. It's most long-term resident was Katherine S. Wheelock, an artist and teacher at Crescent College. She made her home on the cliffside from 1924 until her death in 1960 when Eastview passed into other hands. It is one of the oldest original structures in the historic district.

Harding Spring	36.40555	-93.73727	History	Named for J. Emmett Harding, a photographer who began the tradition of making photographs of people in front of the spring as souvenirs. He built a small dwelling near the spring in the summer of 1879. In 1879, the spring was accessed by a narrow wagon track along a rocky ledge, leaving little room for gathering. Hand labor was required to move a great deal of earth to create a level area in front of the spring. A wide boardwalk and a wood stairway to the top of the cliff were built at that time. Harding Spring is known as the site of one of the most famous healings in Eureka Springs. Twenty-year old Jennie Cowan had been blind for seven years following a severe illness. Jennie used the waters of Basin Spring for several months to no avail. She then began using the waters of Harding exclusively. On August 22, 1880, her sight was restored. Her exclamation'I can see!' created an enormous sensation among the many people visiting Eureka Springs seeking the benefits of the healing waters. Harding Spring is one of the original spring reservations established by Ordinance No. 80 dated February 16, 1886.

A Timeless Place	36.40745	-93.73662	History	The buildings, the bluffs, the spring and The Boulevard all make this a special place in Eureka Springs which has kept a peaceful beauty of earlier times. The front of the McLaughlin Block has changed little since it was built in 1900 to house a very modern grocery and meat market. Stone to construct the building was blasted out of the bluff and cut on-site. Congress Spring flows behind the building. An early writer describes the store:'The grocery store was as clean, polished and sanitary as any drug store I ever saw. In those days there was not a fresh meat counter in every grocery store. Homer kept his hams, bacon and lard and bulky vegetables in a back room... which was a cavelike passage into the bluff, winding and widening until it furnished ample space for keeping butter and anything in his stock that required a low temperature.' Before the library was built, there was an elegant gazebo marking the Spring Street entrance to the Crescent Hotel with a long stairway leading up. The stone gazebo stairway remains to create a grand entrance to the library. (The East Mountain Lookout is a replica of this gazebo.) The Carnegie Public Library was completed in 1912 -- one of two remaining Arkansas libraries built with funds from Andrew J. Carnegie Foundation. The library still has its early charm and visitors are welcome inside. This view with the library in the middle shows a good example of the layering of buildings on the hillsides in Eureka Springs. Rising above are St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church and the Crescent Hotel. This corner is still as charming as when it was'improved' in the late 1880s. The spring gazebo was built in 1885 to replace a simpler one which burned. Landscaping, benches, street lights and sidewalks were also installed then to create a lovely promenade. The current-day Eureka Spring Preservation Society has restored historic street lamps to many of the springs. In The Neighborhood First Presbyterian Church: Built in 1886 from donated stone left after the construction of the Crescent Hotel. The current congregation recently restored the unusual steeple. Powell Clayton: He and his family lived next door. Former governor, senator and Union general, Clayton was one of Eureka Springs' most influential citizens. He was leader of the Eureka Improvement Company who brought in the railroad, built the Crescent Hotel and most of the infrastructure to make this town a fashionable spa resort in the 1890s. The Boulevard: This was the name of Spring Street past Crescent Spring. It is lined with fine homes and cottages which abut the bluff on the west side and drop several stories below on the east. A short walk around the corner is a nod to prehistoric times, a Styracosaurus albertensis from local attraction, Dinosaur World, whose founder once lived in this house. Trail: Note the steps for a walking path up to St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church (open for viewing) and the Crescent Hotel (also open to the public with a fine overlook on the fourth floor.)

Crescent Spring and Trail	36.40774	-93.73614	History	Crescent Spring was revered for its healing waters almost as much as the basin, the legendary Indian Healing Spring. Situated beside the Wagon Road on a hillside with a rocky outcropping described as'crescent' shaped, the spring was soon given that name, as was Crescent Hotel, the fine limestone structure built at its summit in 1886. Street maps dated 1886 show a stone retaining wall and a circular enclosure of stone at the spring. Adjacent to it, twelve stair steps of dressed Beaver limestone lead to a public thoroughfare ten feet in width extending to Park Avenue on the hillside above. Earliest view, an artist's sketch of Crescent Spring, published in 1881, shows a simple wood shed built to shade and protect the waters. The shed was replaced by an ornate wood gazebo with copper clad roof constructed by 1886. Wooden benches, a boardwalk and gas street lamps were in place by 1886, creating a beautiful promenade for resort visitors. Crescent Spring and a reservation of the hillside above and on either side of the spring were set aside in the original plat of the town site surveyed August, 1979 [sic - 1879]. Named spring reservations around the'principal springs', which included Crescent Spring, by name, were established by Ordinance No. 1, enacted April, 1880, upon the incorporation of Eureka Springs as a city.

The Crescent Hotel & Spa	36.40843	-93.73752	History	May 20, 1886... America's newest and most luxurious hotel built at a cost of $294,000. It was two years ago that Powell Clayton and his associates chose the site of the new Crescent Hotel... twenty seven acres at the north end of West Mountain, a majestic location overlooking the valley. The commissioning of Isaac S. Taylor as architect was announced and construction commenced. Special wagons were constructed to transport the huge pieces of limestone from the quarry site on White River near Beaver. Mr. O'Shawnessey, the spokesman of the imported group of Irish masons predicts,'The eighteen inch thick walls of the Crescent, fitted without the use of mortar, would withstand the destructive forces of time and retain its original beauty for many years to come.' The property is lighted with Edison lamps, furnished with electric bells, heated with steam and open grates, has a hydraulic elevator, and is truly a showplace of today's conveniences. - Eureka Springs Echo The article above announced the opening of the wonderful resort. The Crescent Hotel today, recognized as one [of] the few historic hotels of America[,] has undergone several personalities, including the operation of a seasonal girls school, the Crescent College and Conservatory and that of a cancer hospital from 1937-1939. In 1997 however, Martin and Elise Roenick saved the hotel from a sad decline and initiated an aggressive restoration project to recapture the elegance, protecting the irreplaceable. Marty Roenick so perfectly described at the time of purchase his goal[,]'Elise and I have a vision to take the Crescent Hotel in five years to where it was nearly a century ago.' In 2002, this feat has been accomplished as the Crescent Hotel has reopened to its full capacity for the first time in over 75 years.

Grotto Spring	36.41124	-93.73852	History	The words'esto perpetua' emblazoned upon a stone above the entrance to Grotto Spring declare the prevailing belief that these healing waters would flow forth forever. Early townspeople discovered the spring under an overhanging rock ledge, a short distance from the well-known Dairy Spring. Extensive street construction on'The Boulevard', as Spring Street was then called, began in 1890. This necessitated construction of an enclosure of limestone and ornamental stonework hand-worked by very skilled stonemasons. Grotto Springs [sic - Spring] was located only a few steps from the electric streetcar line. Some of the first ordinances enacted by city government were to protect the springs for public use in perpetuity. The wooded area on the hillside above and around the spring is delineated by ordinance that appears to be Oak or Sheffield Spring described in Ordinance No. 81, dated February 15, 1886. The Sheffield family resided nearby in 1880 and may have operated the original dairy for which the hollow below this site was named.
The Town that Water Built	36.41145	-93.73396	History	First by horseback, wagons or on foot, invalids from all over this region flocked to Eureka Springs in 1879 to seek cures from the miraculous healing springs. But soon there were easier ways to arrive - stagecoaches, then trains. This laid a base for an early'industrial park.' Bringing railroad service through the rugged mountains and across the White River was no easy feat. A passage was blasted out of a cliff near Beaver, north of town, a high trestle bridge erected over the river, track laid over smaller creeks and rail bed cut out of bluffs along Leatherwood Creek. The cost was $200,000, very expensive in 1882!'The invalid or tourist who has traveled from the East or North, can leave St. Louis at night and arrive at the Springs the next day... The Kansas City, Springfield & Memphis Railroad run Pullman Parlor Sleeping Cars and chair cars the entire length of their line. All trains reach the city in daylight, and at the depot transfer omnibuses and carriages are in waiting to convey visitors to any hotel or private residence in the city.' W.W. Johnston, M.D., The Eureka Springs Arkansas, 1885 The first Eureka Springs Railway Depot was built in 1882. It was used until 1914 when the current limestone depot was constructed. As part of the extensive Frisco Line, Eureka Springs was finally connected to the rest of the country! Built in 1891 as the city's electric power supply, the Power House had huge coal-fired boilers to run the generators. An ice factory was added later. By 1908 it produced 4 tons of ice daily with 6400 sq. ft. of cold storage. Almost as soon as the town began, Eureka Springs bottled and shipped water from the famous springs. The most enduring company was the Eureka Springs Water Company with their trade name Ozarka. As early as 1904, four train tanks of Ozarka Water from nearby springs were shipped out each week. Rail shipping continued until the 1950s. At one time the Ozarka Water plant used all these large buildings. In the Neighborhood The Round House: Built as the early gas works using limestone quarried north of town. North Main Arts District: A number of studios, galleries and restaurants make North Main Street a pleasant stroll combining art with the natural beauty of the hills and bluffs rising over both sides. Eureka Springs & North Arkansas Railway: A scenic, short-line passenger train offers a trip on part of the original route. Visit the second depot, built in 1913, and the train yards.

The Railroad Depot	36.41387	-93.73392	History	The Eureka Springs Railroad opened in February, 1883. As the first trains arrived at the original station house, a finely crafted wooden structure, passengers were met by horse[-]drawn carriages and hacks which quickly carried them to the best hotels. The railroad, an 18-mile line from Seligman, Missouri, connected to the Frisco railroad system and assured the success of the resort which could easily be reached from great population centers nationwide. By 1900 the railroad was extended across Arkansas. By then named Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, the company ran eight to ten trains daily to Eureka Springs. In the year 1913 the original station house was taken down and replaced with a fine limestone structure which still stands. Adjacent to the depot property stands the ruins of the Eureka Springs Electric Light and Street Railway Company, granted a franchise in May, 1891, to construct a power plant and provide electricity for private consumers and public street lighting. The company began the street railway that year and the system was operated by electricity in 1899. The limestone structure of massive size housed the power plant until destroyed by fire about 1930. An ice house supplied the resort with home-delivered ice for more than half a century until closing about 1960.

14th Arkansas Infantry, C.S.A.	36.41397	-92.90478	History	In 1861, State Sen. William C. Mitchell recruited a company of Confederate soldiers at present-day Lead Hill. Local women led by Mary Coker presented them with a flag. The men mustered into the 14th Arkansas Infantry, and Mitchell was elected colonel. Missouri Gov. Claiborne Jackson inspected the regiment when it was camped here. The 14th Arkansas fought at Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8, 1862. Mitchell was captured during the battle. The 14th Arkansas, with the rest of Arkansass C.S. troops, was sent east of the Mississippi River in April.

Where I Knew I Might Make the Best Fight	36.42020	-94.05584	History	The high bluffs here on Little Sugar Creek were a scene of frantic activity on the morning of March 6, 1862 as Federal soldiers shoveled out rifle pits and cut down trees for hasty field fortifications. With no hope of reinforcements from St. Louis, General Samuel Curtis had only 10,500 men to confront a Confederate army of more than 16,000 marching toward him. Curtis ordered his men to use this creek and the line of steep hills to prepare a strong defense. Sugar Creek's trenches were never used in combat. During the night the Confederates marched completely around these positions. On the morning of March 7, 1862, the Union army had to turn around and fight at Leetown and Elkhorn Tavern. Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis, a 57-year-old West Point graduate born in New York, first took command of the United States Army of the Southwest in St. Louis, Missouri on Christmas Day 1861. To explore the history of the largest Civil War battle west of the Mississippi, start at the National Park Service Visitor Center on Highway 62, about five miles northeast of here.

Purple Heart	36.43341	-94.22989	History	In 1782 General George Washington created a new military badge for Enlisted Men and Non-Commissioned Officers called the Badge of Military Merit. This was the forerunner of the Purple Heart that we know today. The award fell into disuse until General [Douglas] MacArthur changed the award criteria.'A wound which necessitates treatment by a medical officer, and which is received in action with an enemy, may, in the judgement of the commander authorized to make the award, be construed as resulting from a singularly meritorious act of essential service.'
Silver Star Medal	36.43341	-94.22989	History	Criteria: The Silver Star Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Armed Forces of the United States is cited for gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing armed force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in armed conflict against an armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent. The required gallantry, while of a lesser degree than that required for the Navy Cross or the Distinguished Service Cross [or Air Force Cross], must have been performed with marked distinction.
Bronze Star Medal	36.43341	-94.22989	History	The Bronze Star Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the military of the United States after 6 December 1941 distinguished himself or herself by heroic or meritorious service or achievement, not involving aerial flight, while engaged in an action against the enemy of the United States while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in armed conflict against an opposing armed force. Awards for heroism or meritorious service may be made for single acts which are of a lesser degree than required for the Silver Star or Legion of Merit.
Distinguished Flying Cross	36.43341	-94.22989	History	A bronze patee on which is superimposed a four-bladed propeller, the Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Armed Forces of the United States distinguishes himself or herself by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight. The achievement must have resulted in an accomplishment so exceptional and outstanding as to clearly set the individual apart from his/her comrades or other persons in similar circumstances. Awards will be made to recognize single acts of heroism or achievement.
Legion of Merit	36.43341	-94.22989	History	The Legion of Merit was the first American decoration awarded to citizens of Foreign Nations. There are four degrees of award. They are Chief Commander, Commander, Officer, and Legionaire/Legion of Merit. Only the Legion of Merit is awarded to members of the Armed Forces of the United States. Individuals receive this award for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service and achievements. The duty must have been such as to merit the recognition of key individuals.
Air Force Cross 8211; Navy Cross 8211; Distinguished Service Cross	36.43341	-94.22989	History	The Distinguished Service Cross (Army), Navy Cross, and Air Force Cross are equivalent awards. They are given to any service person who, while serving, distinguishes himself or herself by extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of the Medal of Honor. The action must have occurred while engaged in combat with an enemy of the United States. The acts of heroism must have been so notable and have involved risk of life so exceptional as to set the individual apart from his or her comrades.
Medal of Honor	36.43341	-94.22989	History	The Medal of Honor is the highest Military decoration awarded by the United States. It is bestowed on a member of the American Armed Forces, who distinguishes himself or herself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy. The Army, Navy, and Air Force each have a slightly different design for their award, and each presentation is made by the President to the individual or family in case of a posthumous award.

Revolutionary War	36.43348	-94.22977	History	The American Revolution was a conflict between England and thirteen of her colonies in North America. Following years of taxation, suppression, and subjugation by the British, fighting began at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts in 1775. A scant two months later the British attempted to break the colonial siege of Boston, and the Battle of Bunker Hill took place, but the gallant American defense heightened the colonists['] morale. It was immediately preceding this battle that the phrase, Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes, was heard. The Declaration of Independence was declared in July 1776. Small and fragmented American Naval forces made crucial contributions to the war's success. They captured enemy merchant ships and provided vitally needed supplies to General Washington's Army. [Image] Battle of Bunker Hill In many respects, the year 1777 was the most critical year in our young nation's history. The Saratoga Campaign identified the Green Mountain Boys (Vermont and New Hampshire) and Colonel Daniel Morgan's Sharp Shooters (Virginia), both elements were active in the victory at the Battle of Bennington. Many consider this campaign to be the most decisive of the war not only did it encourage the patriots, but it induced the French to fully join the cause. Meanwhile, General Washington established his main camp at Valley Forge near Philadelphia in the winter of 1777-78. His army had dwindled by half to some 10,000 and these were held together by their loyalty to Washington and the patriotic cause. Two distinguished foreigners, General Lafayette and General von Steuben drilled and organized the men, transforming them into a cohesive and integrated military force. [Image] Valley Forge Operations in the south were keeping pace with those to the north. Some historians have described the strategy of patriot Generals' Greene and Morgan as brilliant. Greene's ability to draw General Cornwallis away from his base in Charleston, South Carolina up into North Carolina was vital to the successful southern campaign. General Morgan's astounding victory at the Battle of Cowpens was a skillful tactical accomplishment. The British lost 100 killed (including 39 officers), 230 wounded, and 600 captured to 12 patriots killed and 61 wounded. General Morgan is the same person who commanded the Virginia Sharp Shooters in the successful Saratoga Campaign. It has been stated that General Greene was defeated tactically in nearly every battle, but his campaign was a strategic success from start to finish.

Lewis & Clark Expedition	36.43348	-94.22977	History	The Lewis & Clark Expedition was accomplished by Captain Meriwether Lewis, Captain William Clark, and their fellow explorers, and was the visionary journey of President Thomas Jefferson. The journey was to become one of America's greatest adventure stories. Remarkably, while plans for the travel were being made, the Louisiana Purchase became a reality. In 1803 Jefferson obtained approval from Congress to form a small Army unit to explore the Missouri and Columbia Rivers. The small discovery unit, consisting of some 30 Army personnel and 15 boatmen and woodsmen, began their journey near St. Louis, Missouri in 1804. They spent the winter of 1804-05 in North Dakota, where they hired a French fur-trader as interpreter, who married a Shoshone Indian maiden named Sacagawea. She was to become an important asset to the expedition. In the spring of 1805, having divested itself of the boatmen, the expeditions' [sic] roster showed 2 Captains, 3 Sergeants, 23 Enlisted Men, 2 Interpreters, Clark's man York, and Sacagawea with infant son. They departed North Dakota with six canoes and two pirogues. In Montana, the explorers were faced with their first long portages. Attaching cottonwood wheels to the heavily loaded canoes they were able to negotiate the steep banks and complete the long traverses on the prairie. In July 1805, the expedition reached the vicinity of the Continental Divide, near the tribal lands of the Shoshone. Here the expedition determined its need for horses for riding and as pack animals. Sacagawea's service as intermediary was essential in the succesful negotiations with the Indians. In September, the half-starved expedition reached the village of another friendly Indian tribe, the Nez Perce. Here they built new canoes and left their horses in the care of the Nez Perce. They entered the Clearwater River in mid September, reached the Snake River in early October, and on October 16 they reached the Columbia River. Despite savage winds, squalls, and ocean swells in the estuary, they finally walked the sands of the Pacific in mid-November 1805. Their unprotected exposure to the fierce winter storms and lack of game forced them to find winter quarters. These they found near present day Astoria, Oregon, naming the site Fort Clatsop for their Indian neighbors. Lewis & Clark began the return journey in March 1806. During the winter, the men hunted for food and made clothing from elk skins. The Captains worked on their journal entries: Lewis filled his journal with descriptions of plants, mammals, birds, fish, and Indian culture. Clark drew illustrations of animals, plants, and made maps. On September 23, 1806 the expedition arrived back in St. Louis. The explorers had covered nearly 8,000 miles in two years, four months, and ten days. [Map caption reads]'Following in the Steps of Captains Lewis and Clark'
War of 1812	36.43348	-94.22977	History	Still reeling from the loss of its North American colonies and fighting in a European war, England began to stop and search American ships on the high seas. During such searches, American sailors would be impressed against their will into the British Navy. Resolved once and for all to demonstrate its independence, America declared war against England in June of 1812 and fought battles from Canada to Louisiana. One of the war's darkest hours was the British invasion of Washington, and the burning of the Capital [sic] and the White House. However, following Commodore Perry's success on Lake Erie and General Harrison's victory at the Battle of the Thames River, American dominance was restored in the northwest region. Exhausted by the continuance of the Napoleonic Wars, England negotiated the Treaty of Ghent in 1814. It is ironic that arguably the most famous battle of the war, the Battle of New Orleans, occurred two weeks after the war formally ended. [Image caption reads] Battle of Thames River
The Alamo	36.43348	-94.22977	History	Any discussion of the Battle of the Alamo must begin with the Siege of Bexar, named after San Antonio de Bexar which ocurred [sic] in December 1835. In early December, Bexar was controlled by the Mexicans. On December 5th, a group of Texas volunteers attacked against heavy odds, engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and were successful. Under the terms of a truce the volunteers gained much public property as well as many guns and stores of ammunition. After losing San Antonio to the Texans, the Mexican General Santa Anna, determined to take back this key location, and at the same time impress upon the Texans the futility of resisting Mexican rule. Santa Anna's army began arriving in late February 1836 about two months after the loss at Bexar, and he gradually built up his forces over the next few days. Meanwhile, the Texans, under the command of Colonel William B. Travis, had fortified a former Spanish Mission called the Alamo. On March 6, after periodic bombardment, the Mexicans stormed the Alamo Fortress. The heroic defense of the Soldiers and Texas Volunteers in this battle provided new vigor toward Texas independence.
Mexican War	36.43348	-94.22977	History	War with Mexico was the result of the annexation of the Republic of Texas to the United States in March 1845, which the Mexican government regarded as an act of war since they had refused to recognize Texas' independence. Following the capture of the Citadel of Chapultepec by the American Army, the President of Mexico resigned and the Treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo was signed in early 1848. It was in this war that the beginnings of close cooperation between the Army and Navy became effective in the form of transport, coastal blockade, and the capture of important coastal towns. Under the treaty, the Rio Grande became the boundary between Mexico and the United States, and all or parts of seven states were ceded to the U.S., and Mexico received $15 million for the land.

Veterans Wall of Honor	36.43351	-94.22987	History	Founder's Statement All Who Serve Sacrifice Some Who Serve Sacrifice All Welcome to the Veterans Wall of Honor, honoring all veterans of our Armed Forces who have served in peace and war since the Revolutionary War. In the spring of 2001 Leonard Eisert, one of the founding Directors, presented the idea for a monument to a group of six (6) interested veterans. Out of that meeting was formed the Veterans Council. The Veterans Council of Northwest Arkansas was incorporated in the State of Arkansas in 2001 and is a tax exempt 501(c)3 organization. The Council broke ground on October 1, 2003 and dedicated this impressive structure on November 6, 2004 before a huge crowd headed by the late Lt. Governor Winthrop Rockefeller. A visitor, after passing under the massive arch, will note the 36-foot time line, displaying major military events from 1776 to 2006. On the walls to the right and left rear, one finds 63 bronze historical plaques summarizing events displayed on the time line. The monument is circled by 18 historical flags. As the visitor proceeds inside, he sees the beautiful fountain and is amazed by the 4,167 incised veterans' tablets mounted on the 24 walls. One of the major objectives of the Veterans Council is to inform school groups and the general public of the contributions made by our veterans to secure our nation's freedoms. The Council is also a partner in the Veteran's History Project sponsored by the Folklife Center in the Library of Congress. Architect's Statement The architectural process enables man's primal need to create forms that outlive us. Forms that reflect and honor the human purpose and celebrate the constant renewal of our existence. This monument employs the circular enclosure as the form that historically has offered safe keeping for those contained within and currently for those honored here. The introduction to this monument is through an entrance arch where the visitor is directed toward three concentric circular walls. Walls disposed to reveal in sequence: a time line of military events from the country's inception to the present, a graphic elaboration of those events, and a graphic review of military symbols and inceptive statements. Granite tablets containing engraved names and service reference of these veterans are mounted on the inner face of all circular walls. Focus of the tableau is directed to the central gathering area where visitors can reflect on the service and sacrifices made throughout our military history. The visitor-observer then becomes the observed by that focus, becomes one with those honored and accepts their dedication as his own. A bubbling fountain at the center of the gathering area suggests a constant vigil preserving and protecting the process and spirit of our free society Leonard V.

Cold War	36.43353	-94.22999	History	The Cold War was a period of East-West competition, tension, and conflict short of full-scale war. It was characterized by mutual perceptions of hostile intention between military-political alliances or blocs. Quoting from a Veterans of Foreign Wars publication,'By definition the Cold War would seem to exclude the concept of combat. And for 45 years of its duration, this fiction was maintained----'.'The cold fight to contain communism worldwide (which excludes the full-fledged wars in Korea and Vietnam) involved numerous hostile encounters and claimed the lives of at least 359 Americans.' After Premier Stalin's death, East-West relations went through alternate phases of relaxation and confrontation. A final period resulted in the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the international symbol of East-West confrontation, in November of 1989. It was during this latter period that independence for former USSR republics as well as arms reduction led to increased cooperation between the two powers.
Korea	36.43353	-94.22999	History	On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops started the Korean War by invading South Korea. Two days later, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution calling member nations to help defend South Korea. In all, 16 nations sent troops to assist South Korea over 90 percent were American. By September, United Nations forces had been pushed back to the Pusan Perimeter. On September 15, 1950, UN forces landed at Inchon, cutting off North Korean forces in the south. They pushed all the way to the Yalu River, which separated North Korea from China. Uneasy with UN forces on its border, China intervened in the war and pushed UN forces south of the 38th Parallel. Truce talks began in July 1951, and in July 1953 the two sides signed an armistice ending the war. Deaths: 36,568 Wounds: 103,284 [Photo captions read]: F-86s South Korea'The Forgotten War' [map]
Vietnam	36.43353	-94.22999	History	The 1954 Geneva Accords temporarily divided Vietnam into Communist-controlled North Vietnam and nationalist-controlled South Vietnam. Three years later South Vietnamese Communists, called Vietcong, began rebelling. To try to halt the spread of Communism, America sent military advisors to Vietnam. In 1964, Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution which granted the President the power to escalate American military involvement. In 1965, massive bombing of North Vietnam began and the first U.S. combat troops arrived in Vietnam. Despite the escalation, the war became bogged down in a stalemate. The Tet offensive in 1968 stunned Americans as coordinated attacks by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese regulars swept South Vietnam. Opposition to the war strengthened and in 1973, the United States signed a peace agreement and began withdrawing its forces from Vietnam.

Persian Gulf War	36.43353	-94.22999	History	In 1961 and again in 1973, Iraq had claimed that the nation of Kuwait was part of Iraq. On August 2, 1990, Iraq troop invaded the disputed area claimed by Kuwait. Iraqi invaders looted Kuwait, then headed toward Saudi Arabia. For several months, the United States organized an international coalition against Iraqi aggression. On January 16, 1991, the U.S. and it's allies launched Operation Desert Storm by staging a massive assault against Iraq. On February 23, a successful air and ground offensive was launched from Saudi Arabia, which liberated Kuwait and defeated the Iraqi Forces. A cease-fire was announced on February 28th. Operation Desert Storm was over. Although the war was a decisive military victory for the U.S.-led coalition, the property damage in Kuwait and Iraq was enormous.
War on Terrorism	36.43353	-94.22999	History	The paradox of power is that a weaker nation will seek help from a stronger nation to resolve a problem, then hate the stronger nation because the weaker nation could not solve the problem themselves. Though it was not realized at the time, America's war on terrorism began in 1983 when Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon were bombed, killing 266 and wounding 169. Other acts of terrorism occurred over the next two decades. Most notable of these were the atrocity in Somalia, the tragedy at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and the attack on the USS Cole. However, America was unprepared for the acts of terrorism on September 11, 2001, when hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing thousands. Amidst their shock and sorrow, Americans also found strength and unity. The Bush administration quickly began a massive investigation into the attack, and the President vowed not only to hunt down the culprits, but also to eradicate all forms of terrorism.'The battle will take time and resolve,' Bush declared,'but make no mistake about it: we will win.' The battle continues.
The War in Afghanistan	36.43353	-94.22999	History	The devastating September 11, 2001, attacks on American soil rattled the nation's morale as it became clear the Al Qaeda terrorists sought nothing less than the destruction of the United States of America. Leaders of Al Qaeda had taken refuge in landlocked Afghanistan, controlled by Islamic fundamentalists called the Taliban. When the Taliban refused to hand over leaders of Al Qaeda, the United States launched attacks against the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, and began to provide financial aid to opposition groups in late 2001. Working with anti-Taliban insurgents, United States and allied forces killed or captured many Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters and drove the Taliban from power throughout the country. Al Qaeda leaders were able to escape into the remove snowy mountains of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region where the search continues, though many have been captured or killed. NATO Forces have been introduced into the country to assume various duties, and a President has been elected.'Retribution Continues...' [map]
Operation Iraqi Freedom	36.43353	-94.22999	History	After Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi dictator ignored numerous United Nations Resolutions which resulted in America declaring a'regime change' as an official goal of U.S. policy. In the context of the new terrorist threat after 9/11, the Bush administration accused the Iraqi regime of gross wrongdoing: oppressing its own people, frustrating the U.N. weapons inspectors, developing weapons of mass destruction, and supporting terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. Majorities in both houses of Congress passed a resolution in 2002 which authorized the president to employ armed forces against Iraq. The long-anticipated invasion of Iraq began on March 19, 2003, and the once-vaunted Iraqi military machine collapsed immediately. Iraqi factions jockeyed for political position in the post-dictator era. Insurgents, aided by militants drawn from other Islamic nations, repeatedly attacked American troops. Even though, sectarian violence has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Iraqi', democratic elections have taken place, a Prime Minister has been installed, and a Constitution has been ratified.'A Democratic Hope in the Middle East' [map]
Victory in the Pacific	36.43354	-94.22999	History	The Japanese attack on our military installations in Hawaii was only one of a series of victories in late 1941 and early 1942 gained by them. By the summer of 1942 Japan controlled huge portions of Asia and the Pacific. Fortunately for the United States, the Pacific Fleet's submarines and aircraft carriers were not destroyed by the Japanese sneak attack. By the middle of 1942 America had stopped Japanese expansion in the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway and Guadalcanal. The strategy of island hopping to avoid enemy strongholds was adopted, though not all could be evaded. Before the war would end the American Armed Forces would count at least twenty-one major campaigns, engage in over thirty-six battles, and conduct countless sea-to-land assaults. As the Allies pushed closer to the Japanese homeland the landings became bloodier. The atomic bombings on August 6th and 9th resulted in the surrender of the Japanese and the end of World War II on 2 September 1945.

The War Between the States	36.43359	-94.22983	History	The immediate cause of the War Between the States was the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States in 1860. The deeper cause, however, was the issue of states' rights. The question of states' rights was based on the belief that the United States was a union of independent commonwealths, and that the general government was merely their agent. Thus, when matters could not be resolved, the South felt free to assert their independence and form a new government. The North, however, assumed that Federal Government to be supreme, believed the Union to be one and inseparable, and secession to be a violation of the national compact. In 1861 Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, igniting a war between the states. Heavy casualties in the early battles of the war shattered both sides' illusions that the war would end swiftly. Lincoln ennobled the war in 1863 when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The proclamation did not free any slaves immediately, but it gave the war a high moral purpose. The two most decisive actions of the war occurred in July 1863. The battle of Gettysburg began on July 1 when Confederate forces encountered Union cavalry near the sleepy Pennsylvania town. The three-day battle produced staggering losses: 23,000 Union men and 28,000 Confederates were killed or wounded. After the battle, the Confederates gave up any hopes of invading the North and turned back to Virginia. While the Army of the Potomac was destroying Confederate hopes at Gettysburg, Union forces fought to gain control of the Mississippi River by laying siege to the Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederacy would never recover from the loss at Gettysburg or the surrender of Vicksburg. After four years of bloody warfare, the recognized end of the war came with the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia to Union forces at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, in April 1865. The Gettysburg Address November 19, 1863 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

War with Spain	36.43359	-94.22983	History	There were two principal causes for the war with Spain. The first was the brutality of the methods by which the Spanish Colonial authorities sought to suppress the revolution that began in Cuba in 1859 - methods that outraged the American sense of morality. The second was the mysterious explosion on the battleship USS Maine, which occurred on February 15, 1898, while on a goodwill visit to Havana. Investigations after the war concluded the explosion was accidental, but at the time almost everyone assumed that the Spanish had destroyed the ship. In April America declared war on Spain. The American Army landed some weeks later, and following the Battle of Kettle Hill the Spanish surrendered. As a result of this four-month long war, the United States gained the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Fierce fighting continued in the Philippines for another four years, however, before the insurgency there was brought under control. [Illustration caption reads] The Rough Riders
World War I	36.43359	-94.22983	History	The war to end all wars' began following the assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary in the summer of 1914. Before the summer was over Great Britain, France, Russia, and their allies were at war with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and their allies. Despite its invasion of France, the [C]entral [P]owers were unable to capture Paris and were forced to entrench north of the Marne River. There followed years of trench warfare which would only end with the cessation of hostilities. In 1914 most Americans wanted to stay out of the fighting. However, cultural and economic ties with the western European Allies, and anger at Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare brought the United States into the war in April 1917. For a short period of time Americans served as replacements for allied casualties, but General Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary Force[s], believed in aggressive combat and felt that three years of trench warfare had made the allies too defensive, changed that protocol. Thereafter American soldiers fought as an independent force. During May 1918 the Germans launched their spring offensive and smashed to within fifty miles of Paris. The Americans helped stop the German advance at Cantigny, and several weeks later played a major role in throwing back German attacks at Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Wood. In July and August they helped win the Second Battle of the Marne River. In September the Americans mounted offensives against the enemy at Saint Mihiel, and, in the largest American action at Meuse-Argonne. The Germans requested an Armistice in October. On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, the guns fell silent, and the world was at peace.

The Years Between	36.43359	-94.22983	History	The periods from the end of World War I to 1929 could be accurately described as'boom to bust'. Great new technologies such as the family automobile, talking pictures, radio, and commercial air service were being woven into American lives. Compared to pre-war standards Americans were confident and prosperous. Suddenly in October 1929 the bottom fell out of the stock market, precipitating the Great Depression. At the same time a new president started America on the road to recovery in 1932. By then Italy and Japan had started to invade other countries, and Germany was soon to follow an aggressive military policy. By 1939 Great Britain and France were at war with Germany, and through the Lend-Lease Program the United States began to build and ship war materials to our allies. Following the 1940 election, American industry began a steady growth, and with the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States became the greatest industrial nation in the world.
Triumph in Europe	36.43359	-94.22983	History	Following World War I, the United States remained isolated from world affairs as economic and political factors led to the rise of nationalistic powers in the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, and Japan. A series of bold moves by Germany and weak countermoves by Allied leaders triggered World War II in Europe when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. Hoping to remain insulated, the United States provided aid to nations resisting the Axis Powers, but was drawn into the war when Japan launched her surprise attack on America's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. President Roosevelt proclaimed'...December 7, 1941 a day that will live in infamy...'. On December 8 Congress declared war on Japan. Germany and Italy declared war on the United States three days later. The Allies agreed that the liberation of Europe would be their first priority. Beginning with the invasion of Africa in November 1942, the Allies then invaded Italy, through Sicily, in the spring of 1943. Despite Italy's surrender that summer, stubborn German resistance prolonged the fighting in Italy until the very closing days of the war. The awesome Normandy Invasion began the morning of June 6, 1944 and was followed by the liberation of France. As 1944 drew to a close, German forces launched their last desperate offensive known as the Battle of the Bulge. With staggering losses German forces began defensive actions on German soil. Finally, on May 8, 1945 Germany surrendered. The war in Europe was over, but the war with Japan in the Pacific continued.

Women in World War II	36.43359	-94.22983	History	During the war more than 300,000 women would join the armed forces, many helping to free men to fight on the battlefronts. They served in both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operation as clerks, radio operators, mechanics, ferry pilots, and, of course, nurses. More than 60,000 served as nurses in the Army Nurse Corps. Of this number more than two hundred died, sixteen were killed by enemy action, sixty-eight became prisoners, and many were decorated for bravery. The majority of Navy nurses served state-side, although some were caught up in the Bataan/Corregidor fighting. Approximately 150,000 women served in the Army (WACS), about 100,000 women served in the Navy (WAVES), and the Marines and Coast Guard each had its own womens' service element. While the uniform varied, their dedication to the task at hand was universally exceptional.
The Terrible Cost of World War II	36.43359	-94.22983	History	SACRIFICE: In 1939 the active United States military totaled 335,000, and during the conflict more than 16 million men and women had served. Tens of millions of men and women throughout the world were in military service in other nations of the world. HUMAN SUFFERING: At war's end America had sustained 1,000,000 casualties, nearly 300,000 killed and 700,000 wounded. Throughout the world it is estimated that the total of military and civilian deaths amounted to over 53,000,000. In the countries where battles were fought millions of people were left homeless and entire cities and towns had to be rebuilt. MATERIAL COST: The United States lost 59,000 aircraft, 157 naval vessels and 866 merchant ships. Worldwide over 254,000 aircraft fell from the skies and over 11,000 naval and merchant ships now rest on ocean floors. The direct economic cost to the world has been estimated at one trillion six hundred million dollars.
World War II Home Front	36.43359	-94.22983	History	Following the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the massive American production might was mobilized. After that attack the production of most non-essential consumer goods was halted or curtailed, and manufacturing facilities were converted to war production. A typewriter company produced machine guns, and auto plants produced bombers. Millions worked in these plants, and with so many men in the armed forces 6.5 million women eventually became factory workers. It has been stated, and probably correctly, that without the United States industrial production the war would have been lost. Everyone felt the change as normally abundant consumer goods were rationed. All metals were needed for the production of ships, planes, guns, and ammunition. Gasoline needed to propel all sorts of military equipment was in short supply. Used cooking oils were recycled to make glycerin for explosives. The disappearance of some color dyes was most evident when the dark green used on Lucky Strike cigarette packaging was changed to white, and the company's ads proclaimed'Lucky Strike Green Has Gone To War'. And go to war it did, as it was used to dye millions of Army uniforms OD (olive drab). Never in the history of the world had one nation rallied so fast and produced so much armament so rapidly. From 1939 to 1945 America produced: 41,000,000,000 rounds of ammunition 36,000,000,000 yards of cotton textiles 303,713 aircraft 211 submarines 2,400,000 military vehicles 100,000 tanks and armored vehicles 27 aircraft carriers' 10 battleships 110 escort carriers 83,000 landing craft 41,000 guns and howitzers

U.S. Army Headquarters 1862	36.44054	-94.03174	History	This site was the camp-ground for commanding officers and headquarters of U.S. Army for Battle of Pea Ridge. Here councils of war were held. Camp for 10,500 soldiers. U.S. Army located 1 189 miles south. Depot of supplies 1 mile north of this site.
Getting Ready To Fight	36.44086	-94.03234	History	General Samuel Curtis had only 10,500 troops to hold back a Confederate army of more than 16,000 men moving toward him. Curtis had asked army headquarters in St. Louis for reinforcements. None could be sent. At the last minute, Union soldiers dug in the bluffs just north of Little Sugar Creek, about three miles southwest of here on the Telegraph Road. There - Curtis thought - his army would await Van Dorn's Confederates.

City of Soldiers	36.44098	-94.03223	History	In early March 1862, these now quiet fields bustled with the clamor and constant motion of an army headquarters in time of battle. Soldiers drilled, cleaned guns, and checked ammunition. Scouts and couriers rode in to report. Officers convened for councils of war. Mules brayed and teamsters swore. Teams pulling wagons and artillery rattled by. Here, across the road from Samuel Pratt's store, decisions were made that would determine the fate of two armies - and the state of Missouri. A temporary city of soldiers covered the field before you and the surrounding area. Here you would have seen the nerve center of the Union army during the two-day fight for Pea Ridge. There was heavy military traffic along the Telegraph Road that now lies in part under the battlefield tour road behind you.

The Enemy Is Behind Us!	36.44105	-94.03200	History	It was still below freezing at 10:30 a.m. March 7, 1862, when an alarmed messenger thundered into Union headquarters. The news he carried was startling: Confederates were moving down the Telegraph Road a mile north of Elkhorn Tavern. All of General Curtis's careful troop positioning for a battle at Little Sugar Creek - to the south - was now useless. As gunfire from the far side of Elkhorn Mountain and the fields north of Leetown grew louder, Curtis had to move his remaining troops to prepare for the Confederate attack. Blue-coated regiments reversed direction and rushed past their vulnerable supply wagons to confront the enemy.
A Village Full of Wounded Men	36.44119	-94.05073	History	Entering a little clearing, we discovered the yellow hospital flags fluttering from the gables of every house in the hamlet of Leetown, and the surgeons busy with the sad, yet humane task that was theirs to perform. Lyman G. Bennett, private, 36th Illinois Infantry Regiment The quarter-mile-long trail you see ahead leads to the site of Leetown, Arkansas. Today the woods and meadows of the Pea Ridge battlefield appear to be an uninhabited wilderness. During the Civil War, this whole area was a patchwork quilt of working farms and woodlots. Leetown was made up of a dozen or so log-and-frame homes and outbuildings. As intense fighting ranged nearby in Oberson's cornfield and Morgan's Woods, stretcher bearers carried the wounded of both armies to Leetown, the closest place offering shelter from the winter weather. All the space in the houses was taken over by injured and dying soldiers. Yellow flags guided the walking wounded to medical attention. This 1862 illustration from Harper's Weekly magazine shows Union surgeons working in a combat aid station very similar to those set up in the houses here. No Civil War-era drawing that shows Leetown is known to exist. Battlefield artists did not follow the armies that fought in Arkansas in 1862. Today no structure remains in the clearing where Leetown once was.

They Passed This Way	36.44258	-94.02944	History	Long time we travel on way to new land.... Womens cry... Children cry and men cry...but they say nothing and just put heads down and keep on go towards West. Many days pass and people die very much.' -Recollection of a survivor of the Trail of Tears The Trail of Tears - Land Route After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the United States government forced tens of thousands of American Indians to leave their ancestral lands in the southeast for new homes in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They traveled over established land and water routes, all of which led through Arkansas. Rather than risk disease and other hazards of summer travel, many groups left in the fall and faced, instead, treacherous winter weather. Thousands died during the ordeal - remembered today as the Trail of Tears. Despite the hardships of the journey, the people of the five tribes of the Southeast established new lives in the West. They stand now as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions, while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. Federal Indian Removal In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly removed approximately 16,000 Cherokee, 21,000 Muscogee (Creek), 9,000 Choctaw, 6,000 Chickasaw, and 4,000 Seminole from the southeastern United States. Federal Indian removal policy aroused fierce and bitter debate. Supporters of the policy claimed it was a benevolent action to save the tribes east of the Mississippi River from being overwhelmed and lost in the onslaught of an expanding American population. Opponents decried its inhumanity and the tragic consequences it would have for the Indian peoples. One thing was certain: removal freed millions of acres of Indian lands for use by American settlers. Trail of Tears National Historic Trail In 1987, to commemorate this tragic chapter in American history, the United States Congress designated the primary land and water routes of the Cherokee removal as the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Today the National Park Service partners with the southeastern tribes the Trail of Tears Association and other non-government organizations federal, state, and local agencies and private landowners to foster the appreciation and preservation of historic sites and segments and to tell the story of forced removal of the Cherokee people and other American Indian tribes. You can visit certified sites, segments, and interpretive facilities along the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail by following the Auto Tour Route. Look for the official trail logo along the way.

A Fierce Tangle in Morgans Woods	36.44429	-94.05160	History	...this battle...was a mass of mixed up confusion from beginning to end...Would to God it was night or reinforcements would come. William Watson, sergeant, 3rd Louisiana Infantry Regiment Four regiments of volunteers from Arkansas and Louisiana, moving'with all the vim and vigor [of] regulars,' ran headlong and unawares into two Illinois regiments near here. The close-range fighting was so intense that men from both armies threw themselves flat on the ground to survive the hurricane of flying lead. Military order dissolved. Squads of soldiers rushed from stump to log to tree in the thick, tangled undergrowth, kneeling to fire. An Illinois soldier later said he could not see even 20 feet ahead. Chaos and combat raged through Morgan's Woods all afternoon, as dense smoke from thousands of muskets obscured the darkening forest. (Caption under portrait on the right): Colonel Louis Hebert led the Confederate attack here. When Hebert became disoriented in the smoke-filled woods, Union soldiers took the Louisianan and two other colonels prisoner. Without leaders the Confederate regiments here lost momentum and focus.
Stand to Your Posts!	36.44463	-94.05225	History	Officers and men, you have it in your power to make or prevent another Bull Run affair. I want every man to stand to his post! Nicholas Greusel, colonel, 36th Illinois Infantry Regiment Yankee cavalrymen, mauled from a sharp fight with 7,000 Confederates, raced back across Samuel Oberson's cornfield from the belt of trees you see in the distance.'Turn back! They'll give you hell!' some troopers shouted as they sped by the infantrymen moving into line of battle. Two predominately German-speaking regiments - one from Missouri and one from Illinois - would have to stand and fight here without flinching. If they broke and ran, Pea Ridge would become as infamous as the July 1861 Union disaster at Bull Run near Washington, D.C. Two full divisions - half of the Union soldiers who fought here - were immigrants from central Europe and Germany. These so-called'Dutch' regiments volunteered in St. Louis and other towns along the Mississippi.

A Crisis in Command	36.44476	-94.05256	History	We must not let the men know that General McCulloch is killed. Benjamin Pixley, Lieutenant, 16th Arkansas Infantry The general in charge of this half of the Confederate army - Texan Ben McCulloch - had formed his division, some 7,000 strong, just out of sight behind the trees you see in the distance. Before ordering a massive charge into Oberson's cornfield,'Old Ben,' as his troops called him, rode alone to the edge of the trees for a final scout. Yankee skirmishers behind a rail fence shot the popular general dead. No Confederate soldier or officer saw McCulloch fall. Minutes passed with no word. Finally second-in-command General James McIntosh took over, only to die while leading a charge out of the woods. With no leader to give orders for more than an hour, the momentum that might have led to a swift Confederate victory at Leetown was lost. (Captions under portraits on the lower right): General Ben McCulloch customarily wore a black velvet suit instead of a uniform. As the former Texas Ranger reconnoitered the woods' edge, he was easy to see. General James McIntosh charged at the head of the 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles out of the line of trees and into heavy Federal fire. He died not 200 yards from the spot where McCulloch had been slain.

Save the Cannon!	36.44489	-94.05236	History	Like maddened hornets, Confederate infantrymen boiled out of Morgan's Woods, crossed Leetown Road, and swarmed toward the six Federal cannon that had unlimbered in this corner of Oberson's cornfield. Captain William Black stood in front of the cannon and fired his Colt repeating rifle to single-handedly delay the fierce assault until he fell wounded. Black bought the artillerymen time to save four of the six guns from being captured. (Caption Under Black's Portrait): William Black was 19 years old when he fought here with the 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment. Years later he received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor at Pea Ridge, one of four men so honored. Black survived the war and practiced law in Chicago. I saw two rebel officers rush toward Captain Black with drawn swords and demand his surrender... he struck the nearest with his sword...and leaping over his prostrate form with the agility of a tiger, he struck the other full in the face with his already empty revolver, and he fell like a stone. Samuel McKay, private, 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment

Eugene B. Payne, captain, 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment When the bugles sounded the charge at 10:00 a.m., standing here were 10,000 Union men - an entire army visible from one place. During the Civil War such a sight was so rare that its terrifying grandeur seared itself into the memory of every man present. The Union battle line stretched about a mile across the field before you.

Dat De Shpot, Sergent!	36.44734	-94.02557	History	I saw General Sigel sight one piece...and send a shot at the [rebel] guns that had driven us back...It went tearing in among the men and horses, killing and wounding both, and then exploded in one of the caissons...Placing his glass to his eye to note the effect of his shot, the General said'Dat de shpot, Sergent just put'em right in dare.' Samuel McKay, private, 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment General Franz Sigel ordered the Union gunners positioned here to concentrate on first one Confederate target, then another. Two hours of methodical, massed cannon fire shattered enemy battle lines and morale. Pea Ridge marked the first time this practice was used effectively in a Civil War battle. Franz Sigel learned how to handle artillery as a young officer in Germany. Sigel - the second highest ranking Union officer in the Army of the Southwest - worked his way along the lines, moving from cannon to cannon.

Confederate Sunset	36.44934	-94.02197	History	As the sun set on the first day of battle, about 3,000 rebels from Missouri made their final charge here. Crossing Ben Ruddick's stubbled cornfield, they ran straight toward the muzzles of Federal cannon set wheel hub to wheel hub against a line of trees. After hours of fighting withdrawals, this last Union line held firm. Rebuffed Confederates ebbed back to Elkhorn Tavern. In the dusk, men of both armies feared they were standing on the brink of collapse. ...it was almost dark and we got so near the [Federal] battery that the fire from the guns would pass in jetting streams, through our lines. Asa Payne, private, 3rd Missouri Regiment Outnumbered, hard-pressed Union cannoneers and infantrymen regrouped and reloaded here at the edge of Ruddick's field.
A Perfect Storm of Shot and Shell	36.44944	-94.02219	History	...[the Yankees] opened a perfect storm of round and shrapnell shot and shell...[the ground] was literally ploughed up by cannon ball...It is a perfect miracle that any of us ever came out. John J. Good, captain, Dallas Texas Light Artillery, Good's Battery Here two armies lined up for a second day of fighting after a long, bitterly cold night. Confederate artillerists set up their guns along the edge of these woods. The Union battle line was only 500 yards away - a 5-minute walk - across wide open fields. At 8:00 a.m. the Union cannon bellowed out their first volley, concentrating first on the Confederate artillery positions here. Confederate gunners fired back. The roar of big guns was heard more than 50 miles away. The Yankee barrage went on nonstop for two hours. It was the largest artillery shelling of the Civil War up to that point. The unrelenting bombardment forced the surviving Confederate cannoneers - by then low on ammunition - back to safety at Elkhorn Tavern.

Remembrance and Reunion	36.45310	-94.01667	History	The two stone monuments you see here reflect the long-lasting grief - and the hopes - of the generation of Americans who survived the Civil War. After the war, young men whose lives had been forever changed by this battle began returning to these bullet-shattered forests and blood-soaked fields. They mourned comrades lost and reflected on the meaning of their trial by fire. In 1914 veterans began the call to preserve this battlefield as sacred ground. Their descendants again strove for national recognition in 1924, 1928, 1936, and 1939. In 1956 President Eisenhower finally signed the law to create and protect this legacy as Pea Ridge National Military Park. Confederate veterans raised the older memorial just 25 years after the fight, one of the first in the nation to mark a Civil War battlefield. This stark 1887 obelisk mourned the well-known southern generals lost here: McCulloch, McIntosh, and Slack. The 1889 Pea Ridge reunion was the first to include veterans from both armies. Their marble monument to'A United Soldiery' honored both'the untarnished Blue' and'the unsullied Grey.'

Disastrous Retreat	36.45327	-94.01525	History	It took two weeks for the stunned survivors of the Confederate Army of the West to make their way from here back to rendezvous on the Arkansas River. In late March 1862 General Van Dorn was ordered to take his army east to Mississippi. This left northern Arkansas in the hands of the Union.'[Our] regiment arrived...in straggling squads, tired, hatless, barefooted, hungry, dirty, and ragged. They had been in rain-storms, climbed steep mountains along narrow and rugged foot-paths, waded deep and cold mountain streams, starved, slept without tents or blankets on the wet and frosty ground...The retreat was more disastrous than a dozen battles.' William Tunnard, private, 3rd Louisiana Infantry Regiment Brigadier General Sterling Price, a 52-year-old planter and lawyer born in Virginia, commanded Missouri state troops at Wilson's Creek and Pea Ridge. The popular former congressman and governor of Missouri survived four years of civil war, and died in St. Louis in 1867. Near here Price tried in vain to rally his battered and exhausted division. Many regiments then retreated along this road east toward Huntsville. Other Confederates withdrew to the north and west.

About 356 Cherokee in the detachment led by B.B. Cannon, camped near here on December 23, 1837 - the first removal contingent to travel through the area. Ruddick's farm was a regular supply depot on the Northern Route of the Trail of Tears. From here, the detachments would branch out on several different trails - all leading to Indian Territory, over 30 miles to the west.'...Fine day Monday 18th March.

Lifeline for Two Armies	36.45336	-94.01582	History	Elkhorn Tavern overlooks a highway of vital importance for Arkansas and Missouri during the Civil War. Union and Confederate leaders both wanted this 20-foot-wide dirt road to move men and supplies. Alongside the road ran 3-year-old telegraph wires, the latest way to send information and fast. In the week before battle broke out here, both armies had hurriedly marched southward past this crossroads and tavern. The night before the shooting started, Union troops from Missouri set up a small rearguard outpost here. The soldiers had stockpiled food in the barn and tavern. Provost guards watched a handful of captured Confederates nearby. A Road with Many Names First built in the 1820s as a military road to link St. Louis, Missouri to Fort Smith, Arkansas, this highway served as the northern route of the Trail of Tears during the Indian removals in 1837 to 1839. It was known as the Butterfield Overland Stage Route from 1858 to 1861. Civil War troops called it the Wire Road or the Telegraph Road.
Vulnerable in Victory	36.45373	-94.01549	History	It was the fiery end of the best day of Earl Van Dorn's 20 years as a professional soldier. Bone-tired from the jarring of a week-long ambulance ride and still feverish from pneumonia, the Confederate commander lay down here in the side yard of Elkhorn Tavern amid the wreckage of the day's battle. Because he now controlled his enemy's sole supply line, General Van Dorn assumed he had the battle of Elkhorn Tavern won. No one yet knew that the rebel wagons bearing food and ammunition for the next day's fight were hopelessly out of reach. At midnight two young Texans brought word to Confederate headquarters that Generals McCulloch and McIntosh had been killed early in the Leetown fighting. They took orders back for their entire division to march through the night to rejoin Van Dorn here before sunup.

Elkhorn Tavern Taken	36.45381	-94.01517	History	Confederate commander Earl Van Dorn had pushed his army relentlessly for a week to catch the Union army by surprise. Now, after hours of hard fighting up the Telegraph Road, here in sight of Elkhorn Tavern, Van Dorn gambled by committing all his reserves. As the Missouri State Guard regiments drove back the last Federal defenders, Elkhorn Tavern appeared to be a bold Confederate victory. Like magic the word'Charge!' ran along the line... a battery [of six Union cannon] opened upon us...tearing through our lines...[we] recoiled for an instant under the iron hail...when'On to the battery!' was the cry, and with a yell..we closed upon the opposing ranks...the thunder of the artillery and the opening roll of the muskets...were deafening...the torrent of lead and iron poured through the surrounding smoke. Ephraim Anderson, private, 2nd Missouri Regiment
Two Armies Collide	36.45386	-94.05036	History	Imagine 7,000 Confederate troops crowded in close order along Ford Road, the lane you see on the right edge of this field. As they trudged east toward Elkhorn Tavern, a small Union force of Iowa cavalrymen - only 600 men - unexpectedly appeared from the thick belt of trees you see on the left. Neither force expected to fight here. Three Union cannon unlimbered and fired into the massive rebel formation. Within minutes, 3,000 cavalrymen from Texas and Arkansas turned off the road. With war whoops they swept over Wiley Foster's wheat field. The shattered Federals fled back through the trees. ...with a yell [we] rushed on amid grape and canister... with such irresistible force to the very mouth of the cannon...and in five minutes [the Yankees] were in utter confusion completely routed running in every direction and leaving their cannon in our possession. James C. Bates, lieutenant, 9th Texas Cavalry, Company H Albert Power was 19 years old when he fought here as part of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment. Years later he received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor here at Foster's Farm. No photo of him is known to exist. He survived the war, returned to Iowa, and lived to age 80. Divided Loyalties in the Indian Nations Two regiments of Cherokee riflemen took part in the Confederate charge that captured Union cannon and drove back the Iowa cavalry on this field. Four months later some of these same Cherokee changed sides to fight for the Union. When the American nation was torn asunder in 1861, so were the Five Civilized Nations - tribes that had been removed from their homelands in the southeastern states and resettled in the Indian Territory in the 1830s. Chickasaws and Choctaws quickly chose to ally with the Confederacy. Among Creeks, Seminoles, and Cherokees, loyalties were fiercely divided, especially after the federal government abandoned army posts and stopped treaty payments.

The Butterfield Overland Mail Route	36.45394	-94.01521	History	John Butterfield was born in Berne, New York in 1801 and grew up on a farm amid the technological revolution of the first steamboat, the Erie Canal, the steam locomotive, and the electric telegraph. In 1857, John Butterfield won a lucrative $600,000 contract that called for six years of semiweekly mail service to deliver the mail from St. Louis to San Francisco in 25 days. As soon as the contract was signed, 56 year old John Butterfield set out to complete a rapid survey of the route, taking a staff of helpers from four other express companies. He divided the route into 200 way stations and relay posts. During the year of preparation, Butterfield drove his men relentlessly, and spent more than a million dollars to get the mail route into operation. In September of 1858, they had the items listed at right ready to go. The Overland Stage Company continued to make two trips a week for 2 189 years. Each Monday and Thursday morning the stagecoach would leave Tipton and San Francisco on their transcontinental journey, conveying passengers, freight and up to 12,000 letters. The western fare one-way was $200 gold (equivalent to about $3,000 today), with most stages arriving at their final destination 22 days later. The nation's first trans-continental mail line passes through a future Civil War battlefield In 1858, when the first Butterfield Overland Mail coach stirred up the dust along this road while delivering mail to San Francisco, who would have thought that some four years into the future Union and Confederate artillery wagons would stir the same dust during a bitter Civil War. The first run of the Butterfield Overland Mail departed St. Louis, Missouri on September 16, 1858. The stage entered Arkansas sometime after midnight on Saturday September 18, 1858 a few hours later it passed the Elkhorn Tavern on its way to the first official stop at Callahan's Station about 8 miles from here and then on to Fayetteville, Arkansas which was reached at 11:00 a.m.. Although the Elkhorn Tavern was never an official Butterfield Station it is probable that brief stops were made to rest and water the horses. Twenty-three days and some 2,800 miles later, the stage and mail would arrive in San Francisco, California. This first west-bound mail stage also carried a distinguished passenger list including: Mr. And Mrs. John Butterfield, Judge and Mrs. John Wheeler and their two children from Ft. Smith, T.R. Corbin of Washington, D.C., and Waterman Lily Ormsby, a correspondent for the New York Herald Newspaper. Ormsby said of the trip to Fayetteville, We kept traveling all day and night ... our way during Friday afternoon and evening being through extremely dusty, hilly and stony road ... This brought us to Callahan's, but twelve miles from Fayetteville ... We greased our wagon, changed horses, and got some breakfast all in an incredible short space of time after which we set out for Fayetteville. After leaving Fayetteville, he wrote, Even among these hills you do not lose site (sic) of the prairie nature of the West for just after leaving Fayetteville, you see a fine plain, surrounded by Hills -- in fact, a prairie in the mountains. After a rather rough ride of 14 miles, which we accomplished with our excellent team of four mules to cross the much dreaded Ozark range, including the Boston Mountain. I had thought before we reached this point that the rough roads of Missouri and Arkansas could not be equaled but here Arkansas fairly beats itself. The Civil War brought a sudden end to the Butterfield Overland Mail. Despite its short life, the Butterfield Overland Mail was the first successful attempt to bridge the nation sea to sea. A correspondent's first journey through Arkansas Waterman Ormsby, a correspondent for the New York Herald, recalled the first journey through Arkansas: We kept traveling all day and night. The route leads over those steep and rugged hills which surround the Ozark range in this section of Arkansas. At about 11 o'clock on Saturday morning, September 18, the mail entered Fayetteville and arrived at its station on College Avenue just across the street north of the old courthouse. Here the mail sack was opened and a small addition made. After a change of horses, dinner, and everything being ready, the coach left for Ft. Smith at 12 noon, twenty-two hours and 13 minutes ahead of schedule. Fayetteville was a major stop. The route from Fayetteville through the rugged Boston Mountains to Ft. Smith required that the horses be exchanged for mules, animals that could better make the arduous trip. The trip must have been brutal traveling day and night and more than 100 miles a day. Ormsby remarked after his trip west, Had I not just come out over the route, I would be perfectly willing to go back, but now I know what Hell is like. I've just had 24 days of it.

Night Moves	36.45417	-94.02290	History	I have ordered Generals Sigel and Davis to move with their divisions during the night and form on the left of Carr's division ... and be ready to renew the battle at daylight. The enemy will concentrate his whole force at Elk Horn we will fight him there tomorrow...[I am] certain of success on the coming day. Samuel Curtis, major general commanding, United States Army of the Southwest From this overlook you can see the great challenge facing General Samuel Curtis as two armies grappled on Pea Ridge - how to turn the 10,500 men in the Union army from facing south to facing north, while keeping his supply wagons from being captured. After night fell, Federal divisions that had fought at Leetown had to be brought together with the battered defenders astride the Telegraph Road you see below. Cold and hungry Union men who had marched most of the night had to be fed and issued fresh ammunition. Thousands of men and horses, hundreds of wagons, and dozens of cannons jostled along narrow country roads in the dark. Union officers took little comfort in knowing that the Confederates faced the same demanding task that winter night. Both armies had to reorganize and resupply to be able to fight again.
It was the Grandest Thing I Ever Saw...	36.45418	-94.02292	History	It was extremely rare in the Civil War to be able to see an entire army lined up for a fight, with all the regiments within sight of each other. Had you stood here on Saturday, March 8, 1862, you could have seen 10,000 Union men in battle lines stretching for a mile over the open fields below. It was a sight that few veterans of the battle of Pea Ridge ever forgot. Forward quick time guide right. Halt make ready take aim fire. After first shot load at will. Our guns a-booming. The battery howling. Wounded groaning. Some excited, I might say all. But we was going forward... diary of Samuel Herrington, sergeant, 8th Indiana Infantry Regiment, Davis' Division
Fiery Finale on Ruddicks Field	36.45418	-94.02288	History	The first day's fighting ended at sunset on the large open field you see in the distance below. The half of the Confederate army that had circled completely around Big Mountain - where you now stand - had fought hard all day to force their way up the long mountain hollow that leads to Elkhorn Tavern. As the late winter sunlight faded, Union troops pulled back from Elkhorn Tavern and prepared for a last-ditch defense along the tree line that bordered Benjamin Ruddick's cornfield below. Federal gunners set their cannon wheel hub to wheel hub and waited for the final massive Confederate assault. The white-clad soldiers of the Missouri State Guard who made that last charge were hungry and worn out by the three-day, 60-mile march they had made from the Boston Mountains. Desperate men on both sides knew that what they could do in those last 15 minutes of light might determine victory or defeat.

Slaughter in the Rocks	36.45419	-94.02295	History	Below you here stand 30-foot-tall columns of stone. Bone-tired Confederates of the 2nd Missouri Brigade took shelter amid these rocky dens after the first day's hard marching and fighting. What at first seemed like a good natural defense became a deathtrap. As the second day's fighting began, 21 Union cannon in Cox's field below fired a punishing barrage toward this mountainside. A hurricane of artillery projectiles, rock fragments, and timber splinters tore through the infantrymen posted near here. After 30 minutes of slaughter, General Earl Van Dorn ordered a withdrawal back toward Elkhorn Tavern.

Hard Fighting Near Leetown	36.45422	-94.02296	History	The families who lived outside Leetown, Arkansas first heard shots fired on the far side of Little Mountain, the low wooded rise you see to the right. Half of the Confederate Army of the West was marching eastward on Ford Road, moving this way. To delay their link-up with the other half of the Confederate army nearing Elkhorn Tavern, a small Federal force opened fire across the fields of Wiley Foster's farm. The fighting intensified as Texas and Arkansas regiments moved south from Foster's farm to Samuel Oberson's wide cornfield. Later in the afternoon the action bogged down in a thick 100-acre woods belonging to Elizabeth Morgan. As darkness fell, the Confederates near Leetown pulled back, marching behind Big Mountain - where you now stand - to rejoin their commander on the Telegraph Road.

Pitmans Ferry	36.45638	-90.84195	History	Established by William Hix about the year 1803, the ferry at this place was one of the earliest in Arkansas. It was located on the old southwest trail or,Old Military Road, the major route from St. Louis and the east to Texas and Mexico. A post office opened at Hixs Ferry in 1819, the year Arkansas became a separate territory.  Hixs Ferry became Pitmans Ferry when it was acquired by Preston R. Pitman, the first judge of Randolph County. In 1861 Pitmans Ferry was headquarters of the Confederate Military District of Upper Arkansas commanded by Confederate General William J. Hardee. Civil War skirmishes were fought here October 27 and November 25 1862.
A Long, Cold Hungry March	36.45988	-94.04200	History	I don't believe they ever made a harder march during the Revolution than we made that night. Jack Bower, private, 2nd Missouri Regiment The 16,000-strong Confederate Army of the West spent most of the first week of March 1862 trudging on muddy roads through northwest Arkansas. They traveled some 60 miles from their winter camps deep in the Boston Mountains, beyond the low ridges you see in the distance, to get to Pea Ridge. General Earl Van Dorn pushed his troops hard to sweep completely around his opponent, using a back road called the Bentonville Detour. Van Dorn gambled that if he could capture the Telegraph Road - the only pipeline for Union supplies and communications - he could crush the Union army. The mountain on which you are standing hid the Confederates' approach to the vital highway. The last night was the hardest. The cold was bitter. The men were hungry, because their supply wagons lagged far behind. Snow fell as worn-out soldiers slogged the last eight miles in darkness.

1st Arkansas Cavalry (U.S.)	36.46171	-93.75305	History	The 1st Arkansas Cavalry (U.S.), comprised mainly of Unionist refugees, mustered into service in July 1862. The regiment fought at Prairie Grove in 1862 and Fayetteville in 1863, but its main duty was fighting the bushwhackers and irregular Confederate cavalry that roamed the Ozarks, including Carroll County. One action took place at the Skelton Farm near here, where Company F fought a guerrilla band, killing two and wounding four. The 1st Arkansas Cavalry (U.S.) served until August 1865, losing 110 men in combat and 235 to disease from its 1,765 soldiers.

Chalk Bluff in the Civil War	36.47751	-90.16669	History	Chalk Bluff was a major crossing point for raids between Arkansas and Missouri. On May 1-2, 1863, Gen. John S. Marmadukes Confederates, after crossing the swollen St. Francis River on a makeshift bridge, fought off pursuing Union troops, ending Marmadukes second Missouri raid. On July 19, 1863, Gen. J.W. Davidsons cavalry crossed at Chalk Bluff, beginning a drive down Crowleys Ridge that ended with the Union capture of the capital at Little Rock on September 10, 1863. Chalk Bluff today is one of Arkansass state natural areas.

Chalk Bluff in the Civil War	36.47841	-90.16331	History	Chalk Bluff occupied a strategic position during the Civil War. Its cliffs commanded a vital river crossing on the only major road from Missouri into the Crowley's Ridge country. Provisions were collected here and shipped downstream to Confederate forces. At daybreak on May 15, 1862 Union troops seized the ferry, crossed the river under fire, captured the town and drove the Confederates into the woods.

Chalk Bluff	36.47852	-90.16369	History	Named for the white clay which resembles chalk, this magnificent bluff is one of the most important historical landmarks in Arkansas. At this point the St. Francis River cuts through Crowley's Ridge from west to east and forms the boundary between Arkansas and Missouri. In 1857 David Dale Owen began the first geological survey of the state here.

Chalk Bluff in the Civil War	36.47861	-90.16348	History	On March 10, 1863 Union cavalry captured the ferry after a three-hour fight. They burned buildings and stores of corn in Chalk Bluff and destroyed a large uncompleted ferry boat. Two weeks later on March 24 Union cavalry returned to Chalk Bluff and pursued retreating Confederates as far as Scatterville south of present day Piggott. On April 20 Confederate cavalry surprised and routed a Union encampment across the river from Chalk Bluff.
Chalk Bluff Crossing and Town	36.47916	-90.16241	History	Since Crowley's Ridge provided the only natural route for north-south travel across the lowlands of northeastern Arkansas, an Indian trail and later a military road crossed the river here. About 1840 Abraham Seitz established a ferry which was later operated by Timothy Dalton. The town which grew up near the crossing faded away after 1882 when the railroad bridged the river downstream at the new town of St. Francis.

Action at Salem	36.49595	-91.53607	History	Union troops of the 6th Missouri and 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiments entered Arkansas on March 10, 1862, to keep Confederate troops led by W.O. Coleman, J. Posey Woodside and Archibald McFarlane from banding together. After a skirmish on March 12, the two forces collided at a swamp northeast of Salem on the 13th. A four-hour battle began in which the two sides repeatedly charged back and forth on the edge of the swamp before the Union troops fell back to Missouri after suffering 23 casualties and claiming 100 Confederates dead, wounded and missing.
Civil War in Fulton County	36.49595	-91.53607	History	Fulton County men fought on both sides in the Civil War, and some were arrested in 1861 as members of the Unionist Peace Society. U.S. troops marched through in April 1862 during the Pea Ridge Campaign. Fulton County Confederates struck a Union town in Missouri in 1863, and U.S. troops raided the county at least three times that year, including an August expedition in which the Spring River Mill at modern-day Mammoth Spring was burned as a guerrilla rendezvous. On May 29, 1864, a wagon train of Unionist refugees was hit at Salem. Eighty were killed.
