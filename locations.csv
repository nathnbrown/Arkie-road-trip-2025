The straw was soon ignited, and again we opened with canister for about fifteen minutes. My guns were worked rapidly, making sad havoc in the ranks of the enemy who retreated to the wood. I gave them a few shell as a parting salute, when darkness closed upon us, and we rested upon the field...' (Fifth Panel): General Mosby M. Parsons' Confederates faced the Union attacks here, then counterattacked. He reported: 'At this time the enemy made furious assaults upon my lines with a galling fire from three batteries, and a concentration of their musketry on my center with the evident intention of breaking it.

They Passed This Way,36.44258412,-94.02944103,History,"""Long time we travel on way to new land.... Womens cry... Children cry and men cry...but they say nothing and just put heads down and keep on go towards West. Many days pass and people die very much.' -Recollection of a survivor of the Trail of Tears The Trail of Tears - Land Route After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the United States government forced tens of thousands of American Indians to leave their ancestral lands in the southeast for new homes in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They traveled over established land and water routes, all of which led through Arkansas. Rather than risk disease and other hazards of summer travel, many groups left in the fall and faced, instead, treacherous winter weather. Thousands died during the ordeal - remembered today as the Trail of Tears. Despite the hardships of the journey, the people of the five tribes of the Southeast established new lives in the West. They stand now as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions, while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. Federal Indian Removal In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly removed approximately 16,000 Cherokee, 21,000 Muscogee (Creek), 9,000 Choctaw, 6,000 Chickasaw, and 4,000 Seminole from the southeastern United States. Federal Indian removal policy aroused fierce and bitter debate. Supporters of the policy claimed it was a benevolent action to save the tribes east of the Mississippi River from being overwhelmed and lost in the onslaught of an expanding American population. Opponents decried its inhumanity and the tragic consequences it would have for the Indian peoples. One thing was certain: removal freed millions of acres of Indian lands for use by American settlers. Trail of Tears National Historic Trail In 1987, to commemorate this tragic chapter in American history, the United States Congress designated the primary land and water routes of the Cherokee removal as the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Today the National Park Service partners with the southeastern tribes the Trail of Tears Association and other non-government organizations federal, state, and local agencies and private landowners to foster the appreciation and preservation of historic sites and segments and to tell the story of forced removal of the Cherokee people and other American Indian tribes.

Today the woods and meadows of the Pea Ridge battlefield appear to be an uninhabited wilderness. During the Civil War, this whole area was a patchwork quilt of working farms and woodlots. Leetown was made up of a dozen or so log-and-frame homes and outbuildings. As intense fighting ranged nearby in Oberson's cornfield and Morgan's Woods, stretcher bearers carried the wounded of both armies to Leetown, the closest place offering shelter from the winter weather. All the space in the houses was taken over by injured and dying soldiers. Yellow flags guided the walking wounded to medical attention.

Before ordering a massive charge into Oberson's cornfield,'Old Ben,' as his troops called him, rode alone to the edge of the trees for a final scout. Yankee skirmishers behind a rail fence shot the popular general dead. No Confederate soldier or officer saw McCulloch fall. Minutes passed with no word. Finally second-in-command General James McIntosh took over, only to die while leading a charge out of the woods.

The close-range fighting was so intense that men from both armies threw themselves flat on the ground to survive the hurricane of flying lead. Military order dissolved. Squads of soldiers rushed from stump to log to tree in the thick, tangled undergrowth, kneeling to fire. An Illinois soldier later said he could not see even 20 feet ahead.

Jack Bower, private, 2nd Missouri Regiment The 16,000-strong Confederate Army of the West spent most of the first week of March 1862 trudging on muddy roads through northwest Arkansas. They traveled some 60 miles from their winter camps deep in the Boston Mountains, beyond the low ridges you see in the distance, to get to Pea Ridge. General Earl Van Dorn pushed his troops hard to sweep completely around his opponent, using a back road called the Bentonville Detour. Van Dorn gambled that if he could capture the Telegraph Road - the only pipeline for Union supplies and communications - he could crush the Union army. The mountain on which you are standing hid the Confederates' approach to the vital highway. The last night was the hardest. The cold was bitter. The men were hungry, because their supply wagons lagged far behind. Snow fell as worn-out soldiers slogged the last eight miles in darkness."																				
Fiery Finale on Ruddick's Field	36.45417879	-94.02288035	History	"The first day's fighting ended at sunset on the large open field you see in the distance below. The half of the Confederate army that had circled completely around Big Mountain - where you now stand - had fought hard all day to force their way up the long mountain hollow that leads to Elkhorn Tavern. As the late winter sunlight faded, Union troops pulled back from Elkhorn Tavern and prepared for a last-ditch defense along the tree line that bordered Benjamin Ruddick's cornfield below. Federal gunners set their cannon wheel hub to wheel hub and waited for the final massive Confederate assault. The white-clad soldiers of the Missouri State Guard who made that last charge were hungry and worn out by the three-day, 60-mile march they had made from the Boston Mountains. Desperate men on both sides knew that what they could do in those last 15 minutes of light might determine victory or defeat."

Samuel Curtis, major general commanding, United States Army of the Southwest From this overlook you can see the great challenge facing General Samuel Curtis as two armies grappled on Pea Ridge - how to turn the 10,500 men in the Union army from facing south to facing north, while keeping his supply wagons from being captured. After night fell, Federal divisions that had fought at Leetown had to be brought together with the battered defenders astride the Telegraph Road you see below. Cold and hungry Union men who had marched most of the night had to be fed and issued fresh ammunition. Thousands of men and horses, hundreds of wagons, and dozens of cannons jostled along narrow country roads in the dark. Union officers took little comfort in knowing that the Confederates faced the same demanding task that winter night. Both armies had to reorganize and resupply to be able to fight again."																				
It was the Grandest Thing I Ever Saw...	36.45417555	-94.02292326	History	"It was extremely rare in the Civil War to be able to see an entire army lined up for a fight, with all the regiments within sight of each other. Had you stood here on Saturday, March 8, 1862, you could have seen 10,000 Union men in battle lines stretching for a mile over the open fields below. It was a sight that few veterans of the battle of Pea Ridge ever forgot. Forward quick time guide right. Halt make ready take aim fire. After first shot load at will. Our guns a-booming. The battery howling. Wounded groaning. Some excited, I might say all. But we was going forward... diary of Samuel Herrington, sergeant, 8th Indiana Infantry Regiment, Davis' Division"																				
Slaughter in the Rocks	36.45418957	-94.02295142	History	"Below you here stand 30-foot-tall columns of stone. Bone-tired Confederates of the 2nd Missouri Brigade took shelter amid these rocky dens after the first day's hard marching and fighting. What at first seemed like a good natural defense became a deathtrap. As the second day's fighting began, 21 Union cannon in Cox's field below fired a punishing barrage toward this mountainside. A hurricane of artillery projectiles, rock fragments, and timber splinters tore through the infantrymen posted near here. After 30 minutes of slaughter, General Earl Van Dorn ordered a withdrawal back toward Elkhorn Tavern."																				
Hard Fighting Near Leetown	36.4542187	-94.02296484	History	"The families who lived outside Leetown, Arkansas first heard shots fired on the far side of Little Mountain, the low wooded rise you see to the right. Half of the Confederate Army of the West was marching eastward on Ford Road, moving this way. To delay their link-up with the other half of the Confederate army nearing Elkhorn Tavern, a small Federal force opened fire across the fields of Wiley Foster's farm. The fighting intensified as Texas and Arkansas regiments moved south from Foster's farm to Samuel Oberson's wide cornfield. Later in the afternoon the action bogged down in a thick 100-acre woods belonging to Elizabeth Morgan. As darkness fell, the Confederates near Leetown pulled back, marching behind Big Mountain - where you now stand - to rejoin their commander on the Telegraph Road."																				
Remembrance and Reunion	36.4531044	-94.01667371	History	"The two stone monuments you see here reflect the long-lasting grief - and the hopes - of the generation of Americans who survived the Civil War. After the war, young men whose lives had been forever changed by this battle began returning to these bullet-shattered forests and blood-soaked fields. They mourned comrades lost and reflected on the meaning of their trial by fire. In 1914 veterans began the call to preserve this battlefield as sacred ground. Their descendants again strove for national recognition in 1924, 1928, 1936, and 1939. In 1956 President Eisenhower finally signed the law to create and protect this legacy as Pea Ridge National Military Park. Confederate veterans raised the older memorial just 25 years after the fight, one of the first in the nation to mark a Civil War battlefield. This stark 1887 obelisk mourned the well-known southern generals lost here: McCulloch, McIntosh, and Slack. The 1889 Pea Ridge reunion was the first to include veterans from both armies. Their marble monument to'A United Soldiery' honored both'the untarnished Blue' and'the unsullied Grey.'"

Lifeline for Two Armies	36.45336005	-94.01581675	History	"Elkhorn Tavern overlooks a highway of vital importance for Arkansas and Missouri during the Civil War. Union and Confederate leaders both wanted this 20-foot-wide dirt road to move men and supplies. Alongside the road ran 3-year-old telegraph wires, the latest way to send information and fast. In the week before battle broke out here, both armies had hurriedly marched southward past this crossroads and tavern. The night before the shooting started, Union troops from Missouri set up a small rearguard outpost here. The soldiers had stockpiled food in the barn and tavern. Provost guards watched a handful of captured Confederates nearby. A Road with Many Names First built in the 1820s as a military road to link St. Louis, Missouri to Fort Smith, Arkansas, this highway served as the northern route of the Trail of Tears during the Indian removals in 1837 to 1839. It was known as the Butterfield Overland Stage Route from 1858 to 1861. Civil War troops called it the Wire Road or the Telegraph Road."																				
Vulnerable in Victory	36.45372681	-94.01549354	History	"It was the fiery end of the best day of Earl Van Dorn's 20 years as a professional soldier. Bone-tired from the jarring of a week-long ambulance ride and still feverish from pneumonia, the Confederate commander lay down here in the side yard of Elkhorn Tavern amid the wreckage of the day's battle. Because he now controlled his enemy's sole supply line, General Van Dorn assumed he had the battle of Elkhorn Tavern won. No one yet knew that the rebel wagons bearing food and ammunition for the next day's fight were hopelessly out of reach. At midnight two young Texans brought word to Confederate headquarters that Generals McCulloch and McIntosh had been killed early in the Leetown fighting. They took orders back for their entire division to march through the night to rejoin Van Dorn here before sunup."																				
Disastrous Retreat	36.45327052	-94.01524946	History	"It took two weeks for the stunned survivors of the Confederate Army of the West to make their way from here back to rendezvous on the Arkansas River. In late March 1862 General Van Dorn was ordered to take his army east to Mississippi. This left northern Arkansas in the hands of the Union.'[Our] regiment arrived...in straggling squads, tired, hatless, barefooted, hungry, dirty, and ragged. They had been in rain-storms, climbed steep mountains along narrow and rugged foot-paths, waded deep and cold mountain streams, starved, slept without tents or blankets on the wet and frosty ground...The retreat was more disastrous than a dozen battles.' William Tunnard, private, 3rd Louisiana Infantry Regiment Brigadier General Sterling Price, a 52-year-old planter and lawyer born in Virginia, commanded Missouri state troops at Wilson's Creek and Pea Ridge. The popular former congressman and governor of Missouri survived four years of civil war, and died in St. Louis in 1867. Near here Price tried in vain to rally his battered and exhausted division. Many regiments then retreated along this road east toward Huntsville. Other Confederates withdrew to the north and west."																				
Confederate Sunset	36.44934177	-94.02196839	History	"As the sun set on the first day of battle, about 3,000 rebels from Missouri made their final charge here. Crossing Ben Ruddick's stubbled cornfield, they ran straight toward the muzzles of Federal cannon set wheel hub to wheel hub against a line of trees. After hours of fighting withdrawals, this last Union line held firm. Rebuffed Confederates ebbed back to Elkhorn Tavern. In the dusk, men of both armies feared they were standing on the brink of collapse. ...it was almost dark and we got so near the [Federal] battery that the fire from the guns would pass in jetting streams, through our lines. Asa Payne, private, 3rd Missouri Regiment Outnumbered, hard-pressed Union cannoneers and infantrymen regrouped and reloaded here at the edge of Ruddick's field."																				
A Perfect Storm of Shot and Shell	36.44943563	-94.02218565	History	"...[the Yankees] opened a perfect storm of round and shrapnell shot and shell...[the ground] was literally ploughed up by cannon ball...It is a perfect miracle that any of us ever came out. John J. Good, captain, Dallas Texas Light Artillery, Good's Battery Here two armies lined up for a second day of fighting after a long, bitterly cold night. Confederate artillerists set up their guns along the edge of these woods. The Union battle line was only 500 yards away - a 5-minute walk - across wide open fields. At 8:00 a.m. the Union cannon bellowed out their first volley, concentrating first on the Confederate artillery positions here. Confederate gunners fired back. The roar of big guns was heard more than 50 miles away. The Yankee barrage went on nonstop for two hours. It was the largest artillery shelling of the Civil War up to that point. The unrelenting bombardment forced the surviving Confederate cannoneers - by then low on ammunition - back to safety at Elkhorn Tavern."																				
That Beautiful Charge	36.44733417	-94.0255934	History	"That beautiful charge I shall never forget with banners streaming, with drums beating, and our long line of blue coats advancing upon the double quick, with their deadly bayonets gleaming in the sunlight, and every man and officer yelling at the top of his lungs. Eugene B. Payne, captain, 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment When the bugles sounded the charge at 10:00 a.m., standing here were 10,000 Union men - an entire army visible from one place. During the Civil War such a sight was so rare that its terrifying grandeur seared itself into the memory of every man present. The Union battle line stretched about a mile across the field before you."																				
Dat De Shpot, Sergent!'	36.44734172	-94.02557328	History	"I saw General Sigel sight one piece...and send a shot at the [rebel] guns that had driven us back...It went tearing in among the men and horses, killing and wounding both, and then exploded in one of the caissons...Placing his glass to his eye to note the effect of his shot, the General said'Dat de shpot, Sergent just put'em right in dare.' Samuel McKay, private, 37th Illinois Infantry Regiment General Franz Sigel ordered the Union gunners positioned here to concentrate on first one Confederate target, then another. Two hours of methodical, massed cannon fire shattered enemy battle lines and morale. Pea Ridge marked the first time this practice was used effectively in a Civil War battle. Franz Sigel learned how to handle artillery as a young officer in Germany. Sigel - the second highest ranking Union officer in the Army of the Southwest - worked his way along the lines, moving from cannon to cannon."

Where I Knew I Might Make the Best Fight	36.42019789	-94.05584335	History	"The high bluffs here on Little Sugar Creek were a scene of frantic activity on the morning of March 6, 1862 as Federal soldiers shoveled out rifle pits and cut down trees for hasty field fortifications. With no hope of reinforcements from St. Louis, General Samuel Curtis had only 10,500 men to confront a Confederate army of more than 16,000 marching toward him. Curtis ordered his men to use this creek and the line of steep hills to prepare a strong defense. Sugar Creek's trenches were never used in combat. During the night the Confederates marched completely around these positions. On the morning of March 7, 1862, the Union army had to turn around and fight at Leetown and Elkhorn Tavern. Brigadier General Samuel R. Curtis, a 57-year-old West Point graduate born in New York, first took command of the United States Army of the Southwest in St. Louis, Missouri on Christmas Day 1861.

Red River Campaign	34.21151	-92.548695	History	"Tablet 1 Jenkins' Ferry State Park Act 10 of 1961 authorized this 37-acre state park as a commemorative site and recreation area. The park includes the ferry site where you are standing. The ferry was operated by the Jenkins' family prior to the Civil War and aided travelers on the Camden Road - a major travel route in pioneer Arkansas. In April of 1864, this site gained Civil War fame. Retreating from Camden to the safety of Little Rock, the Union Army was attacked by Confederate forces. General Frederick Steele used the ferry site as a bridgehead for spiriting his troops across the flooded Saline River and out of Confederate reach. Jenkins' Ferry, Marks' Mills and Poison Springs State Parks, and the 1836 Courthouse at Old Washington Historic State Park, which served as the Confederate Capitol of Arkansas at the time of the battle, are included in The Red River Campaign National Historic Landmark. Tablet 2 Red River Campaign (Battle of Jenkins' Ferry) Spring of 1864 saw war's violent hands seize southern Arkansas as Union leaders launched the Red River Campaign. Its purpose was to separate western Confederate forces from the east and to reopen access to Texas cotton. Union mistakes, heavy rain and floods, and strong Confederate resistance doomed the campaign to failure. On April 26, following such overwhelming defeats as Marks' Mills and Poison Springs, the Union VII Corps under General Frederick Steele pulled out of Camden heading north. General E. Kirby Smith's Confederate troops were less than 24 hours behind. The heavy Union wagons moved slowly as torrential rains turned the Camden Road into a quagmire. On April 29, Confederate infantry caught the Union army in the flooded white oak forest of the Saline River bottoms just south of Jenkins' Ferry. The battle raged for two days. Confederate forces mounted three major attacks but failed to halt the Union army's escape. Steele's troops managed to slip across the swollen Saline at Jenkins' Ferry on a mobile wooden bridge suspended by India Rubber pontoons. Once across, the bridge was sunk. Without a bridge, the Confederates could not follow. Bedraggled Union troops moved northward to higher ground where they burned many of their cumbersome wagons. The starving army then pressed on to Little Rock. The Campaign was over! The disastrous Red River Campaign was the Union's last major encroachment into south Arkansas.

Heavy rainfall and thick vegetation made travel difficult for settlers and nearly led to the destruction of Frederick Steele's Union Army in April of 1864. The heavy Union wagons bogged down in the flooded river bottoms south of the river. This gave the Confederates time to attack. Using an India rubber pontoon bridge, the Union Army was able to cross the river and escape."																				
Two Armies Collide	36.45385518	-94.05035824	History	"Imagine 7,000 Confederate troops crowded in close order along Ford Road, the lane you see on the right edge of this field. As they trudged east toward Elkhorn Tavern, a small Union force of Iowa cavalrymen - only 600 men - unexpectedly appeared from the thick belt of trees you see on the left. Neither force expected to fight here. Three Union cannon unlimbered and fired into the massive rebel formation. Within minutes, 3,000 cavalrymen from Texas and Arkansas turned off the road. With war whoops they swept over Wiley Foster's wheat field. The shattered Federals fled back through the trees. ...with a yell [we] rushed on amid grape and canister... with such irresistible force to the very mouth of the cannon...and in five minutes [the Yankees] were in utter confusion completely routed running in every direction and leaving their cannon in our possession. James C. Bates, lieutenant, 9th Texas Cavalry, Company H Albert Power was 19 years old when he fought here as part of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment. Years later he received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor here at Foster's Farm. No photo of him is known to exist. He survived the war, returned to Iowa, and lived to age 80. Divided Loyalties in the Indian Nations Two regiments of Cherokee riflemen took part in the Confederate charge that captured Union cannon and drove back the Iowa cavalry on this field. Four months later some of these same Cherokee changed sides to fight for the Union. When the American nation was torn asunder in 1861, so were the Five Civilized Nations - tribes that had been removed from their homelands in the southeastern states and resettled in the Indian Territory in the 1830s. Chickasaws and Choctaws quickly chose to ally with the Confederacy. Among Creeks, Seminoles, and Cherokees, loyalties were fiercely divided, especially after the federal government abandoned army posts and stopped treaty payments."																				
Elkhorn Tavern Taken	36.45381203	-94.01517034	History	"Confederate commander Earl Van Dorn had pushed his army relentlessly for a week to catch the Union army by surprise. Now, after hours of hard fighting up the Telegraph Road, here in sight of Elkhorn Tavern, Van Dorn gambled by committing all his reserves. As the Missouri State Guard regiments drove back the last Federal defenders, Elkhorn Tavern appeared to be a bold Confederate victory. Like magic the word'Charge!' ran along the line... a battery [of six Union cannon] opened upon us...tearing through our lines...[we] recoiled for an instant under the iron hail...when'On to the battery!' was the cry, and with a yell..we closed upon the opposing ranks...the thunder of the artillery and the opening roll of the muskets...were deafening...the torrent of lead and iron poured through the surrounding smoke.

Battles of Martin Creek and Morgan's Mill	36.2745739	-91.3505137	History	"Near this place, on February 8, 1864, Union and Confederate forces engaged in a 12 mile running battle that ranged from the old Morgan's Mill on Spring River up and across Martin's Creek along the old Indian trail that ran from Memphis to Springfield. The Federals, consisting of the 11th Missouri Cavalry 4th Arkansas Mounted Infantry, and 1st Nebraska Cavalry under the command of Col. Robert R. Livingston, crossed the Spring River and engaged the Confederate forces Freeman's Regiment, Missouri Cavalry under the command of Col. Thomas R. Freeman. The junior officers in charge of the engagement were Capt. M.H. Wolfe of Fristoe's Regiment, Missouri Cavalry, Capt. Joseph B. Love and Capt. Mau V. Shaver's cavalry regiments under Col. Freeman's Command who led most of the charges against Colonel John W. Stephens of the 11th Missouri Cavalry, 1st Nebraska Cavalry under the command of Captain T.J. Majors as well as eight men from the 4th Arkansas Mounted Infantry. Confederate forces out numbered the Federals and gained the advantage on the Baker Farm and ran the Federal Forces back where Hardy is today. This was a clear Confederate victory. Casualties: U.S. 6 killed, 8 wounded, and C.S. 22 killed with several wounded."																				
War Eagle Mill	36.267158	-93.94313	History	"In 1832, Sylvanus Blackburn left Tennessee with a wagon and four oxen, and came to the War Eagle River valley in Arkansas. He spent the winter building a log home and clearing the land of his homestead. He brought his wife from Tennessee the next year. One of Sylvanus' first projects was a water-powered grist mill. In 1838, a flood on War Eagle destroyed the mill. A second mill, four stories tall, was soon erected. Five of Blackburn's sons joined the Confederate Army and the rest of the family went to Texas. The retreating Confederate Army burned the mill on War Eagle to prevent its use by Federal troops. Sylvanus' sixth son, James Austin Cameron Blackburn, built the third mill in 1873. The village of War Eagle grew around the grist mill. There was a sawmill, carpentry shop, and a blacksmith shop, but the grist mill was the center of activities -- socializing, square dancing, and weddings. In 1924, once again the mill burned. For nearly 50 years only the dam and raceway remained. In 1973, centennial year of the original mill, Jewell A., Leta Medlin and Zoe Medlin Caywood built the existing fourth mill on the same foundation as an authentic reproduction of the first mill to preserve the history of grist milling."

The Blues Trail: Mississippi to Helena	34.52283333	-90.58616667	History	"Helena has played a vital role in blues history for artists from both sides of the Mississippi River. Once known as a wide open hot spot for music, gambling, and nightlife, Helena was also the birthplace of King Biscuit Time, the groundbreaking KFFA radio show that began broadcasting blues to the Arkansas-Mississippi Delta in 1941. The program had logged over 15,000 broadcasts by 2009 and inspired Helena to launch its renowned King Biscuit Blues Festival in 1986. (Side 2): The town emerged as a major center of culture and commerce in the Delta during the steamboat era and maintained its freewheeling river port atmosphere well into the mid-20th century. Cafes, night spots, and good-time houses flourished, and musicians flocked here to entertain local fieldhands, sawmill workers, and roustabouts who came off the boats ready for action. Many bluesmen ferried across the river from Mississippi or later motored across the Helena Bridge. Others came from elsewhere in Arkansas, up from Louisiana, or down from Memphis. Helena was at one time home to Mississippi-born blues legends Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson No. 2 (Rice Miller), James Cotton, Honeyboy Edwards, and Pinetop Perkins, as well as to Arkansas natives Roosevelt Sykes, Robert Nighthawk, Robert Lockwood Jr., Frank Frost, Jimmy McCracklin, and George Harmonica Smith, all of whom became influential figures in the blues. Williamson, Nighthawk, and Lockwood were among the first bluesmen to play their instruments through amplifiers, paving the transitional path of blues from acoustic to electric musica development often attributed to Muddy Waters in Chicago in the late 1940s. Soon after KFFA went on the air on November 19, 1941, Williamson's broadcasts on King Biscuit Time brought blues to an audience that had seldom if ever heard such music on the radio. Up-and-coming bluesmen B.B. King, Albert King, Jimmy Reed, and Muddy Waters all tuned in to the lunchtime broadcasts from the KFFA studios, or on occasion from WROX in Clarksdale, advertising King Biscuit Flour and promoting their upcoming shows at local juke joints and house parties. The sponsor, Interstate Grocer Company, even introduced a Sonny Boy brand of corn meal. During Williamson's extended stays away from Helena, drummer James Peck Curtis kept the program going with an assortment of band members. The show eventually switched to records instead of live music and continued with deejay Sonny Payne at the helm. Off the air only from 1980 until 1986, it still ranks as one of the longest-running programs in radio history. The Delta Cultural Center began hosting the broadcast in the 1990s. The Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival, a favorite event among blues enthusiasts around the country, began as the King Biscuit Blues Festival in 1986, welcoming back former King Biscuit Entertainers Robert Lockwood and Pinetop Perkins for the first of many annual appearances, along with a variety of other acts including perennial local favorites Frank Frost, Lonnie Shields, Sam Carr, and CeDell Davis."																				
KFFA 1360 Helena	34.52261073	-90.58616459	History	"The music of the Arkansas Delta is the music of America. With roots in gospel or'church music,' the blues, jazz, country, and rock n'roll flowed from the rich, fertile landscape bordering the lower Mississippi River and spread out across the country and the world. Follow the Arkansas Delta Music Trail to experience the sounds that shaped the land, its people, and the nation. KFFA 1360 Helena King Biscuit Time'King Biscuit Time' first aired live on November 21, 1941, on Helena, Arkansas's KFFA 1360 AM radio. Since that time, the program has become the longest-running daily blues radio show in the United States, as well as an influential platform for up-and-coming blues performers. The award-winning program has aired more times that the'Grand Ole Opry' and has outlasted'American Bandstand' by at least a generation. Legendary bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson was the original host of King Biscuit Time, playing live with Robert Perkins and James Peck Curtis-in the KFFA studio. The show was named after King Biscuit Flour, distributed throughout the Arkansas Delta by Interstate Grocer Company. The company agreed to sponsor a radio production for Sonny Boy and his band in exchange for live commercials for King Biscuit Flour. King Biscuit Time was the first regular radio show to feature blues and has influenced generations of delta blues and rock n' roll artists whose sounds are based on the raw energy of Sonny Boy Williamson's music. The daily programming of Sonny Boy Williamson, Pinetop Perkins, Robert Jr. Lockwood, and other Delta blues legends laid the foundation for the blues, rock, pop, and hip-hop music of today. Award-winning'Sunshine' Sonny Payne has hosted the show since 1951 and has been a presence on King Biscuit Time since its inception in 1941. A recognized blues musician in his own right, Payne welcomes visitors to the live broadcast each week at noon. In keeping with its tradition of broadcasting live music from the studio, King Biscuit Time still welcomes artists in the studio almost weekly, and the show's record-setting 15,000 plus broadcasts document the formation of a true American art form. Under Sunshine Sonny's direction, King Biscuit Time was awarded the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award in 1992, which recognizes outstanding achievement in the field of radio and broadcast journalism. The Delta Cultural Center became'home' to King Biscuit Time in the early 1990's, and the show is broadcast live daily from a special studio in downtown Helena and streamed around the world via KFFA's website, www.kffa.com Arkansas Delta Music Trail Paid for with a combination of state funds and regional tourism promotion association funds www.deltabyways.com"																				
Helena, Arkansas	34.50284103	-90.60379606	History	"At this site on the southern tip of Crowley's Ridge, Indians of the Hopewell Culture lived about 500 B.C. Evidences of their settlements still remain in mounds nearby. In 1541 when Hernando De Soto crossed the river near here, he found the Casqui and Pacaha Indians and held the first Christian service west of the Mississippi River. In 1673 Marquette and Joliet visited here during their exploration. The city was laid out in 1820 and incorporated in 1856. On July 4, 1863, in the Battle of Helena Union forces repulsed a Confederate attempt to retake the city. Seven Confederate generals came from Phillips County."

The Confederates were retreating. Helena remained in Union hands. The Battle of Helena, July 4 1863 The Tyler steamed into action before dawn, firing on Confederate troops near Helena on the Little Rock Road. Two hours later the Tyler's captain, Lieutenant Commander James M. Pritchett, brought the gunboat opposite Battery C. A Barrage of Shot and Shell As the Confederates aimed the captured battery's guns on Fort Curtis, the Tyler opened fire. Her broadside guns poured fire onto Graveyard Hill and into the ravines sheltering sharpshooters. Her stern guns pounded the battery below as her bow guns poured shells into the upper battery. The Tyler's gunners fired 433 rounds of shots and shell with deadly effect. The Tyler's Captain Praised General Benjamin Prentiss, Commander of the Union forces at Helena, wrote Admiral David D. Porter,'Pritchett acquitted himself with honor and distinction...I attribute not a little of our success in the late battle to his full knowledge of the situation.' The U.S.S Tyler Goes to War The U.S. Navy converted the U.S.S. Tyler from a freight passenger steamer to a timberclad gunboat in August 1861. The Boat The Tyler was a paddle wheeler with a wheel at each side. She was 180 feet long and 52 feet wide. The Reinforced Hull Five inches of oak on the upper deck and pilot areas protected the Tyler from small arms fire but nothing heavier. Barges tied alongside helped protected the hull.

Hell-in-Arkansas'	34.52227483	-90.57972193	History	"The nickname the 33rd Iowa Infantry gave Helena was hardly flattering. It came not from a hard fought battle but from miserable conditions in an overcrowded city made worse by the climate. Soldiers Battled Malaria, Typhoid and More Many Union regiments camped in a low area between Helena and the Mississippi River. No one knew that mosquitoes carried malaria and yellow fever. Leander Stillwell contracted malaria soon after he arrived in Helena.'I just lay there, in a hot tent, on the sand, - oh, so sick! But I fought off going to the hospital as long as possible... I had seen so many boys loaded into ambulances, and hauled off to such place, who never returned...' Medical Science was Primitive Most Civil War-era doctors believed that vapors-bad air-caused illness. Doctors did not know that drinking contaminated water led to typhoid, diarrhea and other illnesses. They ordered soldiers to drink water from the river instead of the free-flowing springs. Extreme heat, periodic flooding and overcrowding added to the men's misery. Thousands of soldiers died during the Union occupation of Helena. Most of those deaths could be prevented today.'I remained at the hospital eight days... and retain a distinct recollection of only a few things. But aside from men dying all around me, both day and night, nothing important happened.' Leander Stillwell A Union army camp's graveyard, drawn during the Civil War by Edwin Forbes. Each soldier's grave is marked with a wooden headboard. After the Civil War, the Federal government removed the remains of Union soldiers buried in and around Helena and reinterred them in the National Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.'There are about 30 thousand troops encamped in and around Helena, and I can say without exaggerating that there is buried forty men every day and sometimes more.' Charles O. Musser, 29th Iowa.'Yes, truly, Helena is a city in a swamp... which the valorous Sixth help hold through trying times, in the face of poisonous dangers a hundred fold more damaging and terrifying than the fiercest battlefield.'

The Right to Vote	34.52829876	-90.58681369	History	"The State of Arkansas is Dissolved In 1867, the state of Arkansas ceased to exist. It was dissolved, as were all states still in rebellion when the Confederate government surrendered in 1865. Readmission to the Union required that the states meet two conditions set by the U.S. Congress. Congress demanded that the former states write new constitutions that included universal manhood suffrage, ensuring that former slaves had the right to vote. They were also required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which among other things guaranteed all male citizens 21 years and older the right to vote. The 1868 Constitutional Convention Arkansas held a constitutional convention in 1868 to write a new constitution that satisfied the requirements set by Congress. Most former Confederates no longer had the right to vote. However, male Freedmen over twenty-one years of age did. For the first time, African American men helped write laws in Arkansas. Two of those men were William H. Grey and James T. White, Baptist ministers from Phillips County. William Grey and James White James White and William Grey served as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Little is known about White, but Grey, who had never been a slave, took a very active role. He had worked for former Virginia Governor Henry Wise and understood how government worked. Grey was an outspoken advocate for the rights of Freedmen.'We are here not to ask for charity at the hands of this honorable body, but to receive at the hands of the people of Arkansas, in Convention assembled, the apportionment of our rights,' he declared. The New Constitution A new constitution changed Arkansas. It gave African Americans the right to vote, to serve on juries, serve in the militia, and to hold office. It established free public schools for all and provided for a state university. The 1868 Constitution helped make Arkansas the state it is today."																				
Helena, Arkansas	34.52879595	-90.58630139	History	"Helena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the river', wrote Mark Twain in Life on the Mississippi, and is rich in history and culture. Hernando DeSoto crossed the Mississippi near Helena in 1541, finding a thriving native culture. When Sylvanus Phillips settled in the area in 1797, all indications of the flourishing native American civilization were gone. Helena, Phillips' daughter, was her namesake for this historic river town. Helena, which lies at the southern tip of Crowley's Ridge, is one of the oldest towns in Arkansas. It was an important river town during the Civil War, and the deadly'Battle of Hell' was fought on July 4, 1863, when the Confederate forces attempted to take the town from Federal occupation. Their efforts failed miserably. Helena, home to three separate historic districts, also lies at the intersection of two national scenic byways and is home to over 30 structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Helena also home to one of the largest free Blues festivals in the world, The King Biscuit Blues Festival."																				
Phillips County, Arkansas	34.5288755	-90.58638185	History	"Phillips County lies in what is known as the Mississippi alluvial plain, also called The Delta. The earliest known inhabitants were native Indians, noted for building large earthen mounds for ceremonial purposes and to bury their chiefs. By the time Hernando DeSoto explored Arkansas in 1541 the area was home to two sophisticated Indian cultures, the Casoui and the Pacaha, and included large fortified towns. The point where DeSoto crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas is much debated, with credible evidence that he crossed south of Helena into what is now Phillips County, opposite Sunflower Landing. Between 1541 and 1803, France sold the territory known as the Louisiana Purchase, composed of 900,000 square miles to the United States for 15 million dollars. Phillips County was created by an act of the Arkansas legislature dated May 1, 1820 and named for one of its earliest settlers, Sylvanus Phillips, a member of the Territorial Legislature."																				
West Helena, Arkansas	34.52888765	-90.5864355	History	"The City of West Helena was a vision in the early nineteen hundreds of Edward Chaffin Hornor and John Sidney Hornor, cousins. Their plans for the creation of West Helena on the western slope of Crowley's ridge was accomplished with the filing on June 20, 1910 of a deed of dedication and plat. Their foresight in planning the city provided for residential, commercial and industrial areas. The lot sizes and street widths meet the standards of today's planners. Water and sewer facilities were built and an electric rail street car system was constructed to provide transportation service between Helena and West Helena."																				
We are all the same as dead men'	34.52927546	-90.58801532	History	"Conditions in Civil War Helena were horrible. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water, and mosquitoes led to typhoid, dysentery, malaria and other diseases. Tents, churches, barns, abandoned houses and business buildings housed thousands of sick soldiers. Sick Men, Grim Hospitals Annie Wittenmeyer visited Helena in August 1863. She came with the Western Sanitary commission, an organization much like today's Red Cross. Her report on the military hospitals were grim.'We found the hospitals at Helena, if they may be called hospitals, in a dreadful condition. The Methodist and Baptist Churches were crowded with very sick and severely wounded men. There were very few cots in these two churches. Most of the men were lying in the narrow pews, with the scant uneven cushions for their beds. The weather was extremely hot, and flies swarmed over everybody and everything.' Feeling of Hopelessness Sanitary Commission aids visited a convalescent camp located on the sandy banks of the Mississippi River. The August sun beat down, turning the tents into furnaces. Behind the tents was a wide cypress swamp,'stagnant and green and deadly.' Aid workers brought healthy food, clean clothing and blankets to the camp but the discouraged men told them their efforts were useless.'it is only question of time,' one said,'your efforts will only prolong our suffering we are all the same as dead men. ' 'The faces of some of the men, who were too helpless to keep up a continual fight with them, were black with swarms of hungry buzzing flies.' Annie Wittenmeyer, August 1863"																				
Civil War Comes to Arkansas	34.52822363	-90.58717847	History	"In the first months of 1861 many Phillips County men joined militia companies supporting the Confederate cause. In February 1861, they marched on Little Rock to take the Federal arsenal. Most joined the Confederate army that spring. A Divided Nation on the Brink of War By 1860, many believed that war could not be avoided. Abraham Lincoln won the presidential election in November 1860. Weeks later, South Carolina left the Union. Others followed. The nation unraveled. In the troubled months before and after the presidential election, the men of Phillips County formed seven militia companies, including the Yell Rifles and Phillips Guards. As war drew closer they prepared to defend,'our equality in the Union, our social system, our property, and our liberties. ' 'The Union of States may no longer be regarded as an existing fact.' Arkansas Governor Henry Rector, December 1860. Crisis in Little Rock In early February, rumors began to spread- the Federal government planned to reinforce the Little Rock arsenal. Secessionists in Helena urged the governor to take action. The Yell Rifles, Phillips Guards and other Delta militia marched to Little Rock, ready to take the arsenal by force. Hoping to avoid bloodshed, Governor Rector met with the arsenal commander, Captain James Totten. The badly outnumbered commander agreed to leave. Satisfied, the militia returned to the Delta. Leaving Helena After their return, Miss Emma Rightor, representing the young ladies of Helena, presented a flag to Capt. Joseph C. Barlow of the Phillips Guards. In late April 1861, the Phillip Guards and Yell Rifles left Helena to join the Confederate army. Arkansas did not leave the Union until May, but their Civil War had begun. Many never saw Phillips County again, dying in service to the Confederacy before the Civil War finally ended in May 1865.

He returned to Helena and later became active in the United Confederate Veterans. (Side 2): In Confederate Service Joining the Confederate Army In the weeks following the beginning of the Civil War, one-third of the men in Phillips County fit for military service joined the Confederate army. Several hundred men enlisted between 1861 and 1865. Men from Helena and Phillips County formed all or parts of the 2nd Arkansas, 13th Arkansas, 15th Arkansas, and 23rd Arkansas Infantry regiments, the Helena Light Artillery (Key's Battery) and Dobbins' 1st Arkansas Cavalry. Most of these regiments fought with the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater of the war. Dobbins's Arkansas Cavalry operated in the Trans-Mississippi and fought in the Battle of Helena.

Civilians in Phillips County supported the Southern war effort by purchasing war bonds. Benefits raised money and morale. Many families had sons, brothers or husbands serving in the Confederate Army. (Side 3): The End of Everything They Knew It is impossible for us to fully understand the changes the Civil War brought to Phillips County. Soldiers returning home in the spring of 1865 found that their lives, societyeverything they had known in 1861was no more. Some men could not face the changes and left the country. Archibald Dobbins, a wealthy planter before the war, found his way to Brazil. General Thomas Hindman fled to Mexico, though he returned to Helena in 1868. Bittersweet Homecoming Thousands of men died in the war. Almost everyone in Phillips County mourned someone. General Patrick Cleburne's law partner, Priestly H. Mangum, returned to Helena with only $30 to his name and resumed the practice of law. Patrick Cleburne died at the Battle of Franklin. Robert Caswell Moore was one of the few Helena men in the 13th Arkansas Regiment who returned. James Lanier fought in the Battle of Helena. He returned to Phillips County and resumed farming. His brother, Albert, did not. His family said that his last days were spent in a Federal prison. Rebuilding Lives Joseph C. Barlow worked in the dry goods trade before leaving Helena with the Phillips Guards in 1861. After the war he returned to Helena and opened a hardware store. Jesse P. Clopton and Roland J. Cook survived the war and returned to their farms. Cadwallader Polk, brother of General Lucius Polk, returned to the family homestead and resumed farming but Lucius, his health broken, never returned to Arkansas.

The Arkansas Frontier, 1835-1861 Many ambitious men came to Phillip County before the Civil War, drawn by the opportunities offered by the frontier. Among them were lawyers Charles Adams and James Tappan Patrick Cleburne, an Irish immigrant Archibald Dobbins, a farmer and Daniel Govan, Thomas Hindman and Lucius Polk - men of means. All enlisted in the Confederate army soon after the war began. Serving the Confederacy,1861-1965 James Tappan saw combat first, leading the 13th Arkansas at Belmont, Missouri, in November 1861. Hindman, Cleburne, Govan, Tappan and Polk fought at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Tappan and Hindman returned to Arkansas but the other fought with the Army of Tennessee at Richmond, Perryville, Stones River, Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge. Hindman rejoined them at Chickamauga and they fought together until he was wounded at Kennesaw Mountain. The rest served together until Cleburne's death at Franklin, Tennessee, in November 1864. Hindman became commander of the military district of the Trans-Mississippi. Adams and Dobbins fought with him at Prairie Grove in December 1862. Adams later commanded the Northern Sub-District of Arkansas. Dobbins led his cavalry regiment at the Battle of Helena on July 4, 1863, and commanded a brigade at the Battle of Big Creek in Phillips County in 1864. Tappan fought in the Red River Campaign at Jenkin's Ferry. Returning from the War After the war Thomas Hindman went to Mexico. He was assassinated soon after returning to Helena. Archibald Dobbins fled to Brazil, where he disappeared. Lucius Polk, his health ruined, retired to his family's home in Tennessee. Charles Adams, Daniel Govan and James Tappan returned to Phillips County. Adams moved to Memphis, practicing law until his death from yellow fever. Govan remained in Helena until 1894, when he accepted a post as an Indian agent in Washington State. James Tappan remained in Helena, serving in the state legislature and twice declining the Democratic nomination for governor."																				
The Battle of Helena	34.52243836	-90.58539748	History	"From where you are standing, you would have had a ringside seat for the battle of Helena. On a brutally hot July 4, 1863, Confederate General Theophilus Holmes launched a three-pronged attack on the small Union garrison at Helena. Union defenses centered around Battery A north of here, Battery B northwest of here, Battery C due west of where you are standing, and Battery D southwest of here. Fort Curtis, an earthen fortification was within Helen's city limits northwest of here and the U.S. gunboat Tyler on the Mississippi River behind you provided crucial support in defeating the Confederate assault. More than 7,600 Confederate soldiers, mainly from Arkansas and Missouri, attacked the 4,000 Union defenders of Helena. Only the attack against Battery C succeeded, but it was broken by Union counterattacks and the terrible shells of the Tyler. The Confederate attackers lost 1,636 men killed, wounded and missing or captured. Union forces lost only 239 men.'The ground at this point was impassible - an old road and a deep ravine full of timber, which scattered our men and it was impossible to keep in line but we succeeded in getting through after remaining in the timber and hollows nearly two hours under a heavy fire, and made a charge when, the enemy giving way, we entered the rifle pits. Here many of our men fell, perfectly exhausted from overheat.' Dennis Bahen 37th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, C.S.A'The rest of the batteries got range of them, and the gunboats began to shell them. Oh, what slaughter and bloodshed. They were mowed down by hundreds by grape Shot and Shell. It makes the cold chills run over me as I think of the dreadful Scene I witnessed on the battlefield, men lying in heaps in some of the ravines, four and five deep.' Charles O. Musser, 29th Iowa Infantry Regiment, U.S.A"																				
They Passed This Way	34.5223588	-90.58538675	History	"I have no more land, I am driven away from home, driven up the red waters, let us all go, let us all die together and somewhere upon the banks we will be there.' - Sin-e-cha's Song, heard on several removal boats along the Trail of Tears. After passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the United States government forced tens of thousands of American Indians to leave their ancestral lands in the southeast for new homes in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They traveled over established land and water routes all of which led through Arkansas. Rather than risk disease and other hazards of summer travel, many groups left in the fall and faced, instead, treacherous winter weather. Thousands died during the ordeal - remembered today as the Trail of Tears. Despite the hardships of the journey, the people of the five tribes of the Southeast established new lives in the West. They stand now as successful sovereign nations, proudly preserving cultural traditions, while adapting to the challenges of the 21st century. Lower level of marker: Federal Indian Removal In the 1830s, the federal government forcibly removed approximately 16,000 Cherokee, 21,000 Muscogee (Creek), 9,000 Choctaw, 6,000 Chickasaw, and 4,000 Seminole from the southeastern United States. Federal Indian removal policy aroused fierce and bitter debate. Supporters of the policy claimed it was a benevolent action to save the tribes east of the Mississippi River from being overwhelmed and lost in the onslaught of an expanding American population. Opponents decried its inhumanity and the tragic consequences it would have for the Indian peoples. One thing was certain removal freed millions of acres of Indian lands for use by American settlers. In 1987, to commemorate this tragic chapter in American history, the United States Congress designated the primary land and water routes of the Cherokee removal as the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Today, the National Park Service partners with the southeastern tribes the Trail of Tears Association and other non-government organizations federal, state, and local agencies and private landowners to foster the appreciation and preservation of historic sites and segments and to tell the story of forced removal of the Cherokee people and other American Indian tribes. You can visit certified sites, segments, and interpretive facilities along the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail by following the Auto Tour route. Look for the official logo along the way.

Helena and The Trail of Tears	34.5223588	-90.58538675	History	"The steamer Warren brought news... of the loss of the steamboat Monmouth, and the death of at least one-half of her infamously crowded passengers. This fatal, and most appalling, accident arose from a collision between these two boats but from the best intelligence we can procure the blame rests upon the Monmouth, ... Six hundred {Creek} were jammed into this boat... and three hundred have perished.' - Arkansas Gazette, November 28, 1837. The Water Route to the Indian Territory Here, Helena residents of the 1830s watched tens of thousands of Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Chickasaw pass by as they traveled the Mississippi River. Passengers on steamboats, flatboats, and keelboats, they were on their way to the Arkansas River, and ultimately, to Indian Territory- what is now Oklahoma. Thousands would die, victims of the hardships of the forced relocation from the southeastern United States. Helena, founded in 1820, was a bustling port by the time the removal detachments passed by while traveling west on the Mississippi River to Indian Territory."																				
War Eagle Mills Farm	36.267708	-93.944322	History	"The Ozark Arts and Crafts Fair was founded on War Eagle Mills Farm by Lester and Blanche Elliott and friends in October 1954 for the purpose of giving recognition to Ozark artists and craftsmen who work with their hands and hearts to preserve the rich Ozark heritage. Dedicated to the memory of Lester and Blanche Elliott. The fair was made possible through their devotion to each other and the people they loved. They gave freely of their time, labor and the use of this historic farm for the annual October fair. Erected in 1993 during the 40th year of the War Eagle Fair."																				
Battle of Maysville	36.403986	-94.602073	History	"Occurred on Oct. 22, 1862. While Gen. James G. Blunt was encamped on the old Pea Ridge battlefield, word came that Gen. Douglas H. Cooper and Col. Stand Watie's Indian regiment were at old Fort Wayne across the line from Maysville. On Oct. 20 he advanced his 2nd and 3rd brigades to Bentonville. On Oct. 21, they moved toward Maysville. Crossing the prairie they found the Confederates lined up on the edge of some timber a quarter mile from the town. Before this superior force they retreated in disorder followed by the 6th Kansas Cavalry and the 3rd Cherokee regiment for seven miles."																				
Battle of Massard Prairie	35.31138	-94.38127	History	"On July 27, 1864 Confederates led by Gen. Richard M. Gano surprised an outpost of the Sixth Kansas Cavalry at nearby Caldwell's Place. The Federal force was routed with a loss of 25 killed and wounded, 127 prisoners and much equipment. The Confederates lost 34 men."																				
The Old Mill at T. R. Pugh Memorial Park	34.79121	-92.2493	History	"Dedicated August 6, 1933, as Pugh's Memorial Park, the Old Mill is a replica of an abandoned water-powered grist mill that would have been used by Arkansas pioneers in the 1800s. Although the Old Mill never actually operated as a mill, the iron grist mill on the first floor of the building is authentic and dates to 1828. It served the Cagle family of Pope County for three generations. Developer Justin Matthews intended for the Old Mill to appear as the ruins of a bygone era supplanted by modern methods.'Now completely forgotten by the hurrying world around it, the Old Mill quietly weathers the years in the depths of its secluded valley,' Matthews said of his vision. A memorial to his friend and business partner, Thomas R. Pugh of Portland, Arkansas, the Old Mill with its wheel turning symbolizes Pugh's tireless energy. Millstones on the second floor of the building came from the Ashley County plantation of Tom Knoble, Pugh's grandfather. Frank Carmean of the Matthews Company designed the park and Bob Massey supervised the project. Matthews commissioned Dionicio Rodriguez, a noted Mexican sculptor, whose faux bois (or fake wood) style was perfected in the details of this remarkable work of art. The Old Mill appeared in the opening credits of the 1939 movie, Gone With the Wind."

Confederate [and] Union Occupation of Fort Smith	35.388018	-94.428721	History	"[Side A] On April 23, 1861, the U.S. garrison at Fort Smith abandoned the post as Confederate militiamen approached. Fort Smith became an important recruiting and training center for Confederate forces in west Arkansas. Troops from Fort Smith fought at Wilson's Creek, Mo., in 1861, and participated in the battle of Pea Ridge March 7-8, 1862. Confederate Gen. Thomas C. Hindman led an army from Fort Smith to the bloody combat at Prairie Grove on Dec. 7, 1862. The post remained under Confederate control until Union forces took Fort Smith Sept. 1, 1863. [Side B] On Sept. 1, 1863, U.S. troops under Gen. James Blunt seized Ft. Smith. It remained a Union post for the duration of the war. Fort Smith became a haven for white war refugees and former slaves, many of whom joined the Union army. Fort Smith troops fought in the 1864 Camden Expedition, but most local fighting focused on guerrilla units infesting the area. In the summer of 1864, Union troops withstood a series of Confederate attacks from the Indian Territory. Soldiers and civilians faced a supply shortage until peace came in 1865.

W.J. Murphy - Eads Brothers Building in 1903	35.388238	-94.427038	History	"The first mention of this property is from 1838 when it was part of the brickyard that manufactured bricks to build the second Fort Smith. In 1877 the City Hotel was built here. In 1897, identical buildings were constructed to house the W.J. Murphy Harness and Saddlery Company at 410-12 Garrison. In 1901, Charles and Louis Eads established Eads Brothers Furniture Company in the former Rodgers-Wade building. In 1923, Eads Brothers purchased the Murphy building, removing the walls and combining the buildings. After 95 years in the same location, Eads Brothers relocated not long before the April 21, 1996 tornado hit downtown Fort Smith and Van Buren. The Eads Brothers building survived with minor damage but three days later on April 24, the building exploded into flames soon after the utilities services were reconnected. Three other adjacent businesses were destroyed in the ensuing fire."																				
The Fishback Block in 1872	35.388477	-94.426838	History	"In 1870, ground was broken for the three-story Fishback Block on the site of Jeremiah Kannady's blacksmith shop which manufactured Bowie knives for the Confederate Army. The builder, future Gov. William Meade Fishback (1831-1903), named the 7,000 square foot third floor ballroom after his wife, Adelaide Miller Fishback. Adelaide Hall quickly became the scene of grand balls, beautiful dinner parties, wedding receptions, public meetings and firey political gatherings. City Hall was relocated here. In 1885 the building burned to the ground. Fishback's new two-story building in the same style would be named Adelaide Hall in honor of his wife who had died three years earlier. 110 years later, Adelaide Hall was purchased and completely restored by Richard and Jaunice Griffin."

Bass Reeves - Lawman on the Western Frontier	35.389347	-94.428759	History	"Bass Reeves, a slave born in Arkansas and reared in Texas, rose to become one of the best known and effective deputy U.S. marshals to ride out of Fort Smith for Judge Isaac C. Parker. Recognized as one of the first African Americans commissioned as a federal lawman on the western frontier, Reeves was a master of disguise, expert with firearms, and over a thirty year career, arrested thousands of felons, including his son and minister. Newspapers reported that he killed over twenty men in the line of duty. After leaving Fort Smith, Reeves served the federal courts of Paris, Texas and Muskogee in the Indian Territory. Following Oklahoma statehood in 1907, he worked for the Muskogee Police Department until 1909. Reeves died in 1910 at the age of 71 in Muskogee.

The deeds of African-American and Native American lawmen and citizens were often overlooked in standard history accounts for much of the 20th century. A fuller picture of the diversity of the people who contributed to the development of the United States is available at the Fort Smith National Historic Site as well as the various state and tribal sites and museums across the Arkansas River in the former Indian Territory, now the state of Oklahoma."																				
The Parade Grounds	35.389122	-94.429443	History	"For more than thirty years during the mid-1800s, soldiers drilled on the large parade ground before you. Flanked by the officer's quarters to the right and the enlisted men's barracks on the left, the parade ground was the center of life at the fort. A broad gravel driveway around the grounds encompassed an inner circle and this was the parade ground In the center stood a tall flagstaff, from which dizzy height, Old Glory, flung its protecting folds to the breeze. Morning and evening to the salute of a cannon and the strains of martial music, the flag was raised and lowered.-Mary Rutherford Cravens, recalling life at the second Fort Smith. Gate A When U.S. Army engineers designed the second Fort Smith in 1838, they provided strong fortifications in the form of a large stonewall. Although no military threats to the post ever arose, the wall remained in place until 1897. Today, the location of the wall is outlined by the continuous band of stone behind you. The gateway behind you, Gate A, served as the main gate between the post and the town of Fort Smith."																				
The Women's Jail, 1872-1888	35.388969	-94.429271	History	"After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the guardhouse served the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas. It remained in use as a jail, detaining primarily women suspected or convicted of federal crimes until 1888. At that time, the court moved quarters for female prisoners into the courthouse/jail building. Although not as numerous as their male counterparts, female prisoners were no novelty in Fort Smith. They committed the same crimes as men in the Indian Territory, ranging from illegal sale of whiskey to murder. When convicted, they received the same sentences fines, jail time or death by hanging. From 1873 through 1874 the guardhouse also briefly functioned as Death Row by holding the men condemned to die on the gallows."																				
The Guardhouse, 1849-1871	35.38903	-94.429346	History	"The guardhouse, constructed in 1849, was a focal point of daily activity at the second Fort Smith. Not only did the men assigned to guard detail operate out of this building, but the officer of the day, who was responsible for the daily business of the post, worked out of an office located here. The guardhouse was also the place of confinement for soldiers under arrest for such offenses as drunkenness, desertion, or fighting. The Guard Mount, or changing of the guard ceremony, occurred here once a day usually about 9:00 a.m. At the time, the old guard detail would be inspected and mustered out, and the new guard detail would be inspected and mustered in. Members of the guard detail served as sentries throughout the fort grounds, at each gate, and watched prisoners in the guardhouse."																				
The Flagstaff	35.388816	-94.429408	History	"The U.S. Army built the original flagstaff at the second Fort Smith in 1846. As with many western military posts, the flagstaff stood tall so that its flag could be seen for miles. To attain a height of nearly 100 feet, the army joined two poles in the same way that ship masts were built. Historically, shroud lines attached to cross trees supported the area where the poles were joined, while guidelines and an underground wooden structure stabilized the base. When the army closed Fort Smith in 1871, they removed the flagstaff. The Old Fort Militia, a local citizen support group, in cooperation with the National Park Service rebuilt the flagstaff in 1984-85. Its 37-star flag is a replica of the last flag flown here by the army, from 1867-1871."																				
The Bastion That Never Was	35.389037	-94.429869	History	"When army engineers originally designed the second Fort Smith in 1838, they planned for it to withstand attack. A key feature in achieving this goal was a stone wall about twelve feet high and from two to three feet thick. This wall surrounded the buildings of the second fort. At the five corners of the wall the army intended to construct bastions, two-story fortified firing positions for cannons. Construction on this bastion began in March of 1839 by 1842 the foundation of the structure was nine feet high and five feet thick. Quartermaster General Thomas Jesup inspected Fort Smith in 1845 and ordered this fortification converted into a commissary depot. General Jesup's intervention led to Fort Smith's continued growth by shifting the mission of the post from defense to supply. With supply as its primary mission, Fort Smith became one of the largest and busiest posts in the southwest prior to the Civil War."																				
The Commissary Storehouse	35.387619	-94.429082	History	"This is the oldest building still standing in Fort Smith. Originally built as part of a larger fortification, over the years its appearance and use changed dramatically. The building held supplies used by explorers and soldiers, played a crucial role in two wars, and served as an office for Federal Judge Isaac C. Parker. Today the commissary is furnished with reproductions of supplies that the U.S. Army stored here in the 1850s. A number of posts located farther west benefited from these rations. As part of Fort Smith National Historic Site, the commissary building helps tell one dimension of Fort Smith's rich and varied history"																				
Officer's Garden	35.388805	-94.430065	History	"The walls were almost hidden by a wealth of vines and foliage, and the enclosed space was as green as nature and care could make it. Beautiful flower beds were kept well tended by the soldiers and added greatly to the beauty of the grounds.' Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling Fort Smith in the 1850s A garden provided many benefits to the soldiers and their families at Fort Smith. Fresh vegetables in the garden behind the officer's quarters provided a healthy addition to their daily diet. Herbs were used as seasoning and medicine. Flowers brightened an otherwise monotonous fort life. Working in the garden was part of the daily routine for officers' wives and children. The garden also served as a pleasant gathering place for friends and family."																				
The Officer's Quarters	35.388311	-94.430564	History	"You are now standing on what was once Officer's Row at the second Fort Smith. From 1846 to 1865, two large buildings stood on the western edge of the parade ground and provided housing for officers and their families. Unlike the cramped quarters of the enlisted men's barracks, there was a degree of privacy here. Large front and back porches, yards, and gardens surrounded by picket fences provided further domestic comforts. Fire destroyed both Officer's Quarters in 1865 and 1870. In 2000, the National Park Service placed the concrete pads here to show the approximate locations and floor plans of both buildings. The Cistern Following the Civil War, the U.S. Army constructed a dome-shaped cistern between the two officer's quarters. This underground storage tank is 22 feet deep and holds 55,000 gallons of water. The cistern, enlisted men's barracks and the commissary are the only structures remaining from the second Fort period (1838-1871). Captain Samuel Sturgis, Commander at Fort Smith, 1859-1861, Officer's wives and children shared the trials and tribulations of military life with their husbands and fathers. At Fort Smith, Sturgis' son, Jack was badly burned when two other boys accidentally exploded twelve pounds of gunpowder. Jack carried a facial scar until his death as a lieutenant at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876."																				
Fort Wall	35.387792	-94.43076	History	"Security has always been a concern for the U.S. military. The army designed the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) as part of a line of forts from Minnesota to Louisiana to separate the territory occupied by Native American tribes from that settled by American citizens. To provide protection in the event of an attack, military engineers called for the construction of a fort with five bastions (gun emplacements), and a massive stonewall that was 12 feet high and 2 feet thick. Fort Smith represents the last of a dying breed from the 1840s on, virtually all frontier forts were built without walls. After Fort Smith was built, the cost of constructing a wall was considered too great in comparison to the benefit of a fortified defense. The fort walls remained in place throughout the federal court era (1872-1897), affording a level of security for proceedings and the executions that took place. Today the location of the original wall is outlined by continuous band of stones."																				
Defending Freedom	35.387911	-94.430508	History	"I never saw such fighting done as was done by the negro regiment The question that negroes will fight is settled besides they make better soldiers in every respect than any troops I have ever had under my command. General Blunt after the Battle of Honey Springs, July 17, 1863. Black infantry drilled on the parade ground in front of you. At various times during the Civil War, Fort Smith housed four regiments of U.S. Colored Troops (USCT). One was organized locally. Drills increased after Confederate soldiers mercilessly massacred black troops who had surrendered at Poison Springs in 1864. Many of the troops were former slaves. Later that year, the 11th USCT, on duty in Indian Territory, battled Confederate cavalry in one of many skirmishes fought by Fort Smith troops. By war's end about 10 percent of all Union troops were USCT regiments."																				
The Gallows	35.387666	-94.430119	History	"With the largest criminal jurisdiction of any federal court at the time, the Western District of Arkansas handled an extraordinary number of murder and rape cases. When a jury found defendants guilty in these capital cases, federal law mandated the death penalty. In Fort Smith, that meant an execution by hanging on a crude and unsightly gallows. A visitor to the city in 1893 recommended constructing a new gallows to evoke the sacredness and majesty of the law. This was never achieved and a year after the last execution, the city of Fort Smith destroyed the gallows structure. I do not desire to hang you men. It is the law. Judge Isaac C. Parker"																				
Executions at Fort Smith	35.387681	-94.430151	History	"During the twenty-four years the federal executions took place in Fort Smith, eighty-seven men died on the gallows. While Judge Isaac C. Parker sat on the bench, 160 people, including four women, were sentenced to hang. Just over half received a reprieve from execution through pardons, commutations, reversals or acquittals on appeal, or death in jail. The men listed below were hanged in Fort Smith.

Confederates Occupy The Fort	35.388232	-94.430041	History	"At the beginnings of the Civil War, amid the firing of cannon and the cheers of the people, a local newspaper reported, Arkansas State Militia raised the Confederate flag and took control of Fort Smith on April 23, 1861. With the Confederate victory in South Carolina at Fort Sumter, the U.S. War Department ordered all southern forts abandoned. Despite pleas of concerned citizens, U.S. troops (later called Union troops) left Fort Smith just an hour before state militia arrived. The transition took place without conflict. While Arkansas militia troops controlled the fort, citizens of Fort Smith and the surrounding region remained deeply divided. Many pro-Unionist kept silent, suppressed their loyalties, or left town. After Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863 followed by Confederate defeat west of Fort Smith at Honey Springs, Union forces reclaimed Fort Smith in September 1863."																				
Meeting of Nations	35.388425	-94.429821	History	"The Fort Smith Council was held in this building in September 1865. To establish relations following the Civil War, delegates of twelve Indian nations met with President Andrew Johnson's representatives. Bitterly divided, Indians had fought for both sides in the war, but the United States now treated them all as defeated enemies. Tribes were told their rights had been forfeited, their slaves must be freed, and their property could be confiscated. The Council ended with little resolved. Not expecting to sign treaties, and concerned that tribal sovereignty was at stake, the Indians simply pledged allegiance to the United States. A year later in Washington, D.C., tribes signed separate treaties with the federal government."																				
Barracks, Courthouse, Jail	35.388225	-94.429383	History	"The building in front of you is very much as it appeared in the 1890s. First built as a military barracks, it was later converted for use as a courthouse and jail. Over time its appearance changed to accommodate different needs of the people using it. Compare these photographs to the building you see today. Notice clues of its former appearance by examining bricked-in-windows, remnants of porch foundations, changing rooflines, and brick color variations."																				
Welcome to Fort Smith	35.388174	-94.428976	History	"Founded in 1817 by the U.S. Army to contain a volatile Indian feud, Fort Smith later served as a major supply depot for western military posts, and finally as headquarters of the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas. For over 80 years, the federal government used Fort Smith to establish and maintain law and order in the Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma). Fort Smith National Historic Site preserves the remains of these two military posts and the federal court. During your visit, make sure to visit the following locations at the park.

Fayetteville Center Square	36.062407	-94.16012	History	"The Fayetteville Square served as the location of the Washington County courthouse from 1837 to 1904, when a new courthouse was built facing Center Street on College Avenue. Title to the public square (Block 27) was conveyed to the United States of America, and work on this post office, which began around July, 1909, was completed in 1911. Urban Renewal planners intended to tear this building down in 1974. The public objected. It was then purchased by Donald E. and Edna Bumpass in 1978. In cooperation with developers Keith Cearley and Ronald E. Bumpass, it was totally restored, renovated, and placed on the National Register of Historical Places. The building has been a focal point for redevelopment of the Fayetteville Square, and its preservation has drawn public attention to the significance of safeguarding the community's cultural heritage and architectural splendor.

Evolution of Fayetteville	36.062407	-94.16012	History	"The earliest known inhabitants of the hardwood forest of the Ozarks migrated to Arkansas over 12 thousand years ago through the Great Bering Strait. For the next two thousand years Bluff Dwellers hunted the mountain plateaus before the Quapaws, Cherokee and Osage fished the bountiful lakes and streams and hunted the grassland prairies of the Arkansas highlands. Buffalo herds roamed this area. It was not until 1819 that the first white man saw Fayetteville's hilltop terrain. On March 2, 1819, Congress created the Arkansas Territory. On October 17, 1828, Washington County was established, and Fayetteville was chosen as the capital site. The county commissioners were authorized in 1834 by Congress to sell 160 acres to underwrite the building of a proper Courthouse on this Square. The sale that took from 1835-1837 raised $6340.00 and the courthouse was built in 1837. Several Courthouses graced this site until 1911 when the Old Post Office was constructed.

A solid shot from Fagan's Confederate Battery on October 3, 1864 pierced the west wall of the house. The Stone House survived the war, as did the Rieff house directly across the street and both are still standing in 1965. Stephen K. Stone and his wife, Amanda Brodie Stone, were public-spirited citizens and made handsome donations to such causes as City Hospital, Methodist Church and the Fayetteville Female Seminary. The Stones' daughter Mary (Mrs. George Albright) was the last graduate of the Seminary in 1860."

The Razorbacks	36.066375	-94.166165	History	"Following a 16-0 victory over LSU in Memphis on Nov. 13, 1909, the University of Arkansas football team was greeted at the Fayetteville train station across the street by a crowd of fans and students. Arkansas was 5-0 after the win and would finish 7-0. Head coach Hugo Bezdek delivered a speech to the crowd, saying the team played like a wild band of razorback hogs. The name was a hit with the student body, which voted in 1910 to change the official mascot from Cardinals to Razorbacks, giving Arkansas one of the most unique and recognizable mascots in the country. This marker was placed in recognition of 100 years of the Razorbacks. [Dedicated] July 21, 2009"																				
The State and Land-Grant University of Arkansas	36.066727	-94.168888	History	"The University of Arkansas came into being under the Morrell Land-Grant College Act of 1862, through which federal land sales established colleges devoted to agriculture and mechanic arts, scientific and classical studies, and military tactics for the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes. It also satisfied the provision in the Arkansas Constitution of 1868 that the General Assembly establish and maintain a State University. Fayetteville and Washington County raised $130,000 for the new college, which held its first classes January 22, 1872, on the William McIlroy farmstead, a location described as second to none in the State of Arkansas."

The Western District Courthouse	36.400845	-93.738786	History	"Eureka Springs was incorporated on Valentine's Day in 1880. At that time, the only courthouse was in the county seat of Berryville, some 12 miles to the east. This was a great distance at the time, the roads were bad, and the King's River had to be forded if it was passable. As a result, the citizens of Eureka Springs petitioned for their own courthouse, and in 1883, the Arkansas General Assembly enacted legislation to create the Western Judicial District of Carroll County. In 1906 Claude A. Fuller was elected mayor of Eureka Springs. A rented room was being used as a courthouse and the town wanted a new one. The problem was to get the Quorum Court, composed of all the Justices of the Peace in the county, to approve an appropriation for the purpose of building the courthouse. The night before the matter of the appropriation was to come before the Court, Mayor Fuller discovered that two Justices of the Peace from the Western District of the county were absent, and he needed their votes. He telephoned the Chief of Police in Eureka Springs and instructed him to go out on horseback, leading two horses for the justices to use, and bring the absent ones in. The following morning at 5:00, the Chief of Police and the two reluctant justices rode into Berryville. When the Court met and the matter was put to vote, those two justices made it a tie. Tom Fancher, the County Judge broke the tie by voting for the appropriation, and that is how Eureka Springs obtained its courthouse. It was designed and constructed of native limestone by W.O. Perkins and Son in 1908."																				
The Civic Center	36.400955	-93.738608	History	"These two large limestone public buildings anchor this part of downtown Eureka Springs. They span the deep ravine cut by Leatherwood Creek which flows in a tunnel beneath all the buildings on this entire part of Main Street. [Photo 1.] This view shows South Main Street toward Basin Park in the 1890s before the Auditorium was built. The large Southern Hotel is shown in the center. This very early lodging survived all the great fires in the 1880s and 1890s which destroyed most of the town's early wooden buildings. It had grown to over 100 rooms when it too burned in 1933. [Photo 2.] Carroll County Western District Courthouse is viewed here shortly after construction in 1908. Note the deep ravine on both sides. When the ravine was filled for parking, a'moat' was left around the lower level. A bronze plaque in front tells the Courthouse story. [Photo 3.] The whole town turned out for the Auditorium Groundbreaking Ceremony on April 11, 1928. This view is toward the north from the Courthouse. The Auditorium was opened by the John Philip Sousa Orchestra on September 13, 1929. It offered a spacious theater and a basement gymnasium which served local schools until the 1960s. It was renovated in 2005 with a matching U.S. Department of the Interior Save America's Treasures grant. In The Neighborhood Rock House Cave: Across from The Auditorium is a wooden stairway which is actually Rock House Avenue, a city street. Up the stairs, behind the building is Rock House Cave, viewed only from the stairway. It was said to be a hospital during the Civil War where injured soldiers were treated with water from Basin Spring. In early rough days of Eureka Springs, it was the popular Rock House Saloon.

Civil War Healing	36.401341	-93.738256	History	"The Eureka Springs area's reputation as a health resort has its origins in the Civil War. Late 19th-century accounts claim Dr. Alvah Jackson treated sick and wounded soldiers during the war. In early 1865, Maj. J. W. Cooper, who led Confederate troops in the Indian Territory, came to Carroll Co. with four comrades seeking Jackson's aid to recover form the effects of hard service. They holed up in the'rock house' near the area's abundant springs and recuperated. Cooper and his companions returned for a reunion with Jackson at the springs in 1880."																				
The Basin Bath House	36.40164	-93.737416	History	"Basin Bath House was established 1879 adjacent to Basin Spring by Dr. Alvah Jackson's son, Thomas. John S. Tibbs succeeded Jackson about 1880, operated bath house and Eureka Water Shipping Company. Building was destroyed by Great Fire of 1888, replaced with limestone and brick structure 1889. Skillful, authentic restoration after 1986 Fire preserved this historic structure."																				
The Southern Hotel	36.401833	-93.737648	History	"The Southern was built in the year 1880 adjacent to Basin Spring and some 25 feet above it on the hillside. L.M. Rainey of Missouri, its original owner, sold the hotel to W. E. Beatty in 1886, at which time it was acclaimed to be one of the city's two finest hotels, the other being Perry House, situated on the opposite side of the spring. Damaged in the Great Fire of 1890, The Southern was repaired and enlarged to one hundred rooms, gas lighted throughout, and boasting for a time an outdoor'elevator' which lifted guests from Basin Spring level to hotel entrance. Wallace McQuerry owned the hotel in 1932 and had renamed it Southern Home. On November 12 that year this handsome wooden structure which stood for just over half a century was destroyed in what the Times-Echo and other newspapers described as'a spectacular blaze.'"

Beaver Jim Villines	36.0189	-93.3574	History	"Settling Along the Buffalo Abraham Villines and his children were among the earliest pioneer families in the Buffalo River valley. Abraham's grandson William built this log house in 1850 for his new bride, Rebecca. Four years later their son James was born here. James Villines (1854-1948) was known as Beaver Jim for his renowned trapping ability. After his marriage in 1880, he moved from this home to his own farmstead across the Buffalo River. In the mid-twentieth century, Villines family descendants used this house as a barn---with the chimney still attached. Today, the notched and hand-hewn logs recall the pioneers who carved their homes out of the Buffalo River wilderness.

A Monarch Returns	36.0048	-93.3679	History	"What an exciting discovery to come across an elk roaming the fields and woodlands of the Buffalo River country. Once again these large members of the deer family can be found grazing or resting in clearings and open spaces. Native to the hardwood forests of the Ozarks, an eastern subspecies became extinct by the 1840s. At the prompting of local citizens, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission re-introduced 112 Rocky Mountain elk along the Buffalo River in 1981. Although the elk adapted to their new habitat, parasites, poaching, and road kills have limited their population growth. Nonetheless, these majestic mammals appear to be extending their range in the Buffalo River region. Elk may weigh up to 800 pounds, compared to a 150-pound white-tailed deer. Elk Viewing Tips: Keep your distance. Elk are large, wild animals that can seriously injure you! Use binoculars or telephoto lenses for a better view. Morning and evening are best time for viewing, especially in winter. Use of elk calls or spotlights in the park are prohibited. This exhibit was funded by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, with support from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in cooperation with the National Park Service."																				
Boxley Valley	36.0041	-93.375	History	"When establishing Buffalo National River in 1972, Congress recognized the need to preserve the valley's culture as well as its free-flowing river. Here in Boxley Valley, a traditional farm community is being perpetuated within the borders of Buffalo National River. To do this, the National Park Service and local citizens created a long-term plan to keep the valley privately owned to retain its historic integrity. The community spirit that has endured for more than 150 years is now preserving Boxley Valley for generations to come. Boxley Valley is entered on the National Register of Historic Places, not only for its more-recent cultural heritage but also for the evidence the valley has yielded of 12,000 years of human occupation.

Bathhouse Row	34.5118	-93.0539	History	"The buildings along Bathhouse Row are the latest stage in a succession of bathhouses. In the 1830s Hot Springs' earliest facilities were makeshift shelters perched over individual springs. Later, elaborate Victorian bathhouses flourished along the avenue, but the wooden structures were susceptible to rot and devastating fires. The present mix of Spanish mission and neoclassical architecture dates from 1911 to 1939, the Golden Age of Bathing. The Buckstaff remains open for traditional bathing, while the National Park Service preserves Bathhouse Row as a significant national cultural landmark. Captions: Hale Bathhouse on Hot Springs Creek, 1867. Assembly room in Fordyce Bathhouse.

An American Spa	34.5116	-93.0537	History	"Bathhouse Row is the historic heart of an American spa. Since the 1830s the city of Hot Springs has channeled much of its energy into becoming a national health resort. The Federal Government made taking the waters available to all by providing baths and health services to veterans and the poor, and the National Park landscaped many of the exercise paths that were considered essential to good health. Some of the bathhouses have closedlocally, demand for the medicinal baths peaked in 1946but you can still discover the spa experience. Traditional bathing remains available at the Buckstaff Bathhouse and some nearby hotels. Like earlier visitors, you can stroll the beautiful brick Grand Promenade behind Bathhouse Row or hike mountain trails throughout the National Park.

Lamar Bathhouse	34.5123	-93.0537	History	"The present masonry Lamar Bathhouse, completed in 1923, has a symmetrical, California style of architecture. The large lobby contains nostalgic murals of historic landscapes, and country scenes. Art Deco stairs, signs, and lights decorated the building. Advertising a tub for every-sized person, the Lamar Bathhouse also featured a large sun porch to promote natural health. Like many Victorian bathhouses, the wooden 1890s Lamar Bathhouse had stickwork decorations and railed roof walkways. An investigator wrote of the buildings' vulnerability: All agree that the vapor from the hot water rots all timber with which it comes in contact in remarkably short time No more wooden buildings should be allowed. Captions: Lamar Bathhouse in 1923 Sun porch of the first Lamar, about 1898"																				
Buckstaff Bathhouse	34.5121	-93.0538	History	"From its opening the handsome Buckstaff Bathhouse aggressively promoted its image. To gain customers the owners mounted a huge sign on the roof to attract people from the large hotels a block away. Other bathhouses lost character as they modernized, but the Buckstaff kept its historic appearance and emphasized its reputation for service. Although many of its competitors closed between 1962 and 1985, the Buckstaff continues to operate as a bathhouse. On Bathhouse Row it is the sole operating survivor from the Golden Age of Bathing. Captions: Men's bathhall around 1920. Buckstaff Bathhouse, 1920. Built in 1911, the Buckstaff's neoclassical style inspired park superintendent Harry Meyers to write that the building resembled the Irish House of Parliament."																				
Ozark Bathhouse	34.5127	-93.0538	History	"The mission style of the Ozark Bathhouse may relate to the claim that Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto visited the hot springs. The building's twin towers are strictly decorative. On Bathhouse Row, the Quapaw, the Fordyce, and Hale Bathhouses, with their red clay roof tiles, also reflect this Spanish association. The Ozark's scroll and shield decorations and classical designs on window planters suggest a relationship with Roman baths. Caption: The Ozark as it appeared in 1915 (above) and in 1882 (right)."
